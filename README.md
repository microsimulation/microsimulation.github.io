This repository provides files used to create a RePEc listing for the Journal.

To update the RePEc listing, modify files on master branch and push changes to GitHub. GitHub Action will automatically start a workflow updating gh-pages branch and generating an updated listing of the files at https://microsimulation.github.io/ This will subsequently be picked up by RePEc within a few days.
