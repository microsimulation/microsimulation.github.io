Title: The financial implications of working longer: An Application of a Micro-Economic Model of Retirement in Belgium 
Abstract: In this paper, the costs and benefits associated with postponing retirement are simulated in 
a standard simulation model for Belgium, using the approach of Stock and Wise (1990). 
Unlike earlier microsimulation-based applications of this approach, such as Gruber and Wise (1999, 2004), 
this model does not take a representative sample as the point of departure, but simulates the costs and 
benefits of postponing retirement for four fictitious employees, representing male and 
female white- and blue-collar workers. While confirming conclusions drawn by other authors, this model 
allows for the separation of specific retirement schemes, and of the effect of different fiscal regimes for
those retired and working. It is shown that differences between retirement schemes show up in differences 
in replacement rates and by whether or not the retirement benefit is a function of career length. Furthermore,
advantageous fiscal regulations for the retired have a strong impact on the implicit costs of postponing retirement.

Title: Simulating disease transmission dynamics at a multi-scale level
Abstract: We present a model of the global spread of a generic human infectious disease using a 
Monte Carlo micro-simulation with large-scale parallel-processing. This prototype has been constructed and 
tested on a model of the entire population of the British Isles. Typical results are presented. A microsimulation 
of this order of magnitude of population simulation has not been previously attained. Further, an efficiency 
assessment of processor usage indicates that extension to the global scale is feasible. We conclude that the 
flexible approach outlined provides the framework for a virtual laboratory capable of supporting public health 
policy making at a variety of spatial scales.

Title: Dynamic microsimulation of health care demand, health care finance and the 
economic impact of health behaviours: survey and review 
Abstract: This paper reviews the issues to be faced in attempting to create a microsimulation of health
care demand, health care finance and the economic impact of health behaviour. These issues identified
via an in-depth review of seven dynamic microsimulation models, selected from an initial set of 27
models in order to highlight the main differences in approaches and modelling options currently adopted.
After presenting a brief description of each of the seven selected models, the main modelling approaches
are summarized and critically appraised using five main distinguishing criteria. These criteria are the use
of alignment techniques, model complexity (as reflected in the range of variables used), theoretical
foundations, type of starting population, and the extent and detail of financial issues covered. Building
upon this appraisal, the paper goes on to show how the 12 SAGE lessons apply in the field of health care
microsimulation. The trade-off between complexity and predictive power is shown to be key. Finally an
appendix summarises the main features of all 27 of the dynamic microsimulation models originally
surveyed.

Title: FiFoSiM - an integrated tax benefit microsimulation and CGE model for Germany 
Abstract: This paper describes FiFoSiM, the integrated tax benefit microsimulation 
and computable general equilibrium (CGE) model of the Center of Public Economics at the 
University of Cologne. FiFoSiM consists of three main parts. The first part is a static 
tax benefit microsimulation module. The second part adds a behavioural component to the 
model; an econometrically estimated labour supply model. The third module is a CGE model 
which allows the user of FiFoSiM to assess the global economic effects of policy measures. 
Two specific features distinguish FiFoSiM from other tax benefit models: 
First, the simultaneous use of two databases for the tax benefit module and second, 
the linkage of the tax benefit model to a CGE model.

Title: The Life-Cycle Income Analysis Model (LIAM): a study of a flexible dynamic 
microsimulation modelling computing framework 
Abstract: This paper describes a flexible computing framework designed to create a 
dynamic microsimulation model, the Life-cycle Income Analysis Model (LIAM). 
The principle computing characteristics include the degree of modularisation, 
parameterisation, generalisation and robustness. The paper describes the decisions taken 
with regard to type of dynamic model used. The LIAM framework has been used to create 
a number of different microsimulation models, including an Irish dynamic cohort model, 
a spatial dynamic microsimulation model for Ireland, an indirect tax and consumption 
model for EU15 as part of EUROMOD and a prototype EU dynamic population microsimulation 
model for 5 EU countries. Particular consideration is given to issues of parameterisation, 
alignment and computational efficiency.

Title: Income tax statistics analysis: A comparison of microsimulation versus group simulation
Abstract: Microsimulation based on income tax statistics may be useful in tax reform 
discussions. Unfortunately, access to appropriate data is still rather restricted 
and expensive for ad-hoc analyses, and individual data is often even not available at all.
In this paper we take Germany and its data situation as a proxy for many countries? 
restrictions in terms of tax data availability. Analyzing how much reliability and 
robustness of results we lose if we employ group simulation instead of microsimulation, 
we compare both methods. Investigating tax scale effects by the group model leads to very 
good results. Determining the financial effects of modified tax bases, the deviation 
from the microsimulation results increases, especially if tax base cuts vary between 
taxpayers. In addition, we take account of the class of taxpayers with a negative taxable 
income. Neglecting this class we identify a systematic underestimation of the financial 
consequences of a modified tax base with the group model assuming a progressive tax scale.
If the group simulation data is not arranged according to the taxable income, but rather 
according to the total amount of income, we also find a tendency towards higher 
deviations from the microsimulation results. Quantifying the tax revenue effects of 
alternative tax settings the group simulation model represents a good compromise between 
the desire to capture the complex reality and the achievable accuracy when facing limited
resources and data. Furthermore, for those cases in which group simulation is the 
appropriate tool, we provide a very simple method to interpolate a suitable income 
distribution and thereby the tax distribution within the classes. This interpolation 
makes future estimates of tax revenues a lot easier. We conclude that, although 
microsimulation in general is the superior approach, a group simulation model remains of 
interest, especially for analyses of rather old data and cross-country analyses, when 
sufficiently detailed data for micro analyses is missing.

Title: Combining microsimulation with CGE and macro modelling for distributional 
analysis in developing and transition countries
Abstract: This paper overviews recent work that has attempted to bring together 
microsimulation, Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) and macro models to perform 
distributional analysis in developing and transition countries. Particular attention 
is paid to applications relating to aspects of economic growth and political economy. 
Applications in which macro, CGE and microsimulation models are either layered or 
integrated are considered. It is demonstrated that different combinations of such 
models, including those where only a single model-type is used, are appropriate for 
different problems. For short-run impact analysis, microsimulation on its own may be 
appropriate. For longer-run analyses, where interest is in the interrelationship between 
changes in disposable income, consumption and labour supply, these models need to be 
supplemented a combination of microsimulation on the one hand, and general equilibrium 
price changes or changes in macro variables on the other hand. In the case of national 
subregions, or countries embedded in free-trade areas, it is argued that microsimulation 
may adequately be combined with pure macro models. That is, CGE modelling may not be 
necessary. For distinct national economies, however, the first step beyond microsimulation 
should likely be integration with CGE modelling. Whilst much promising work has been 
undertaken on dynamic integrated CGE microsimulation work in developing countries, 
CGE work is most advanced for Less Developed Countries. At present several groups of 
development researchers are found to be putting these two approaches together, and in 
some cases are adding macroeconomic and financial modelling as well. In contrast, with a 
few conspicuous exceptions, little such work is being done for the transition economies.

Title: Econometric flexibility in microsimulation: an age-centred regression approach
Abstract: This paper describes a strategy for estimating predictive equations 
that has been shown to work well in microsimulation modelling. The technique, referred to 
here as ?age-centred regression,? is particularly useful when the available data set for 
estimating a model equation is limited and the marginal effect of one or more explanatory 
variables might be expected to vary systematically by age. The examples used here to 
describe how age-centring works are taken from the labour supply equations in the 
Congressional Budget Office Long-Term (CBOLT) dynamic microsimulation model. By switching 
from a traditional single-equation approach to age-centred regression, we show that 
marginal effects of independent variables can vary significantly across age groups. 
The comparison also reveals that improvements in mean predictions by age can be achieved 
with little if any loss in statistical precision of coefficient estimates.

Title: Dynamic spatial microsimulation using the concept of GHOSTs 
Abstract:  This paper presents a novel method of creating and updating geographical 
population microdata. In particular, it presents a prototype modelling technique which 
forms a component of the SimBritain modelling project. The paper first briefly discusses 
some of the key conceptual and practical issues involved in microsimulation, in particular 
highlighting the differences between spatial and aspatial microsimulation models. 
The paper then outlines a potential alternative to fully stochastic event-driven spatial 
dynamic microsimulation. This alternative uses longitudinal data to produce and project 
Generic Household Spaces Through Time (GHOSTs), all within a spatial modelling framework. 
To this end the paper first outlines how to derive GHOSTs from longitudinal data, then 
explains how the attributes of these GHOSTs can be projected forward in time.

Title: Predicting the need for aged care services at the small area level: 
the CAREMOD spatial microsimulation model 
Abstract: Most industrialised societies face rapid population ageing over the 
next two decades, including sharp increases in the number of people aged 
85 years and over. As a result, the supply of and demand for aged care services
 has assumed increasing policy prominence. The likely spatial distribution 
of the need for aged care services is critical for planners and policy makers. This article describes the development of a regional microsimulation model of the need for aged care in New South Wales, a state of Australia. It details the methods involved in reweighting the 1998 Survey of Disability, Ageing and Carers, a national level dataset, against the 2001 Census to produce synthetic small area estimates at the statistical local area level. Validation shows that survey variables not constrained in the weighting process can provide unreliable local estimates. A proposed solution to this problem is outlined, involving record cloning, value imputation and alignment. Indicative disability estimates arising from this process are then discussed.

Title: Towards a multi-purpose framework for tax-benefit microsimulation: 
lessons from EUROMOD 
Abstract: Tax-benefit models provide tools for policy analyses that should 
enable researchers to focus their attention on formulating policy scenarios 
and analysing their effects. From the users? and the developers? points of 
view, numerous characteristics and features are desirable to maximise the 
model?s usefulness. A model framework that offers generalised components 
essential for tax-benefit modelling while at the same time providing a large 
degree of flexibility in defining the specific parameters can be re-used for
a multitude of modelling purposes. This paper discusses issues arising in the 
construction of such a general framework and illustrates possible approaches 
by reference to the the framework developed for construction of the EUROMOD 
tax-benefit model. EUROMOD is an integrated tax-benefit microsimulation model 
covering 15 (pre 2004) countries that are members of the European Union 
(Immervoll et al, 1999) as well as 4 of the New Member States. Implementing 
this many tax-benefit systems in one single consistent framework requires a 
robust yet flexible structure. The framework needs to reflect the basic 
structural characteristics of tax-benefit systems while leaving enough room 
for a diversity of particular instruments and rules. This paper outlines the 
general model framework adopted. We argue that, apart from its direct 
usefulness for EUROMOD, the framework has far wider applicability as a 
general approach to static tax-benefit microsimulation modelling.

Title: Research Note - Estimating the effects of a major reform in additional child 
Sven Stöwhasebenefits granted to German low-income households 
Abstract: This research note provides a short overview of the difficulties 
associated with the estimation of the short-term fiscal effects of a major 
reform in additional child benefits granted to German low-income households. 
We briefly discuss the methodology used to construct both an appropriate 
database and to operationalise the microsimulation model. Of particular note 
are the imputation of heating costs and the conversion of that part of 
household incomes used to determine past entitlement to additional welfare 
benefits (accountable income) into gross household incomes. Finally, the role 
of the model within the legislative process is roughly outlined.

Title: Case Studies - Health&WealthMOD: a microsimulation model of the 
economic impacts of diseases on older workers 
Abstract: The Australian Government is seeking to encourage older workers to 
remain in the labour force longer to overcome future labour shortages and 
ensure adequate taxation revenue to fund the needs of an ageing population. 
Longer labour force participation also has benefits to individuals in terms 
of available income and capacity to save for a better standard of living in 
retirement. While the Government recognises that not all older workers are 
able to participate in the labour force, there is little information on what 
health conditions keep people from working, or what the costs are to the 
government or the individual. This case study outlines how a new micro
simulation model, Health&WealthMOD, is being designed to fill this information
 gap by estimating the economic impacts of illness. The general approach adopted
 is outlined, following which two early applications of the model are presented. 
The model is used to explore the determinants of the duration spent in 
retirement and to generate projections of retirement due to illness to 2020.

Title: A non-parametric microsimulation approach to assess changes in inequality and poverty
Abstract:  This paper presents a non-parametric microsimulation methodology for assessing the impact of labour market changes 
and government transfers on income inequality and poverty at the household level. The approach assumes that labour markets are 
segmented and determines (as part of a randomized process) which individuals are expected to move in or out of employment and 
which move from one employment segment to another based on either known or counterfactual information of aggregate labour market changes. The methodology assumes that the distribution of earnings of those who become employed in a particular segment resembles that of the individuals observed to be employed in that segment. The approach can be effectively combined in top-down fashion with static or dynamic computable general equilibrium (CGE) models, which typically provide insufficient information about household income distribution. The paper discusses the virtues and limitations of applying this methodology and further explains to practitioners how to implement it as a stand-alone methodology or in combination with a CGE model. It also shows how the methodology can be generalized to also capture the poverty and inequality effects of changes in non-labour incomes, such as government transfers. One great advantage of this method is that it is not very demanding in terms of modelling labour supply and household behaviour as compared with alternative parametric approaches, while at the same time providing a plausible link between 
changes in overall labour market conditions and the full household income distribution.

Title: Sequential macro-micro modelling with behavioural microsimulations 
Abstract: This paper presents a sequential methodology that combines a macroeconomic CGE model with a behavioural 
microsimulation, illustrates the approach with applications, and discusses its merits and shortcomings. The microsimulation, 
based on a household income generation model, allows for incorporating individual fixed effects into macro-micro analysis. 
We argue that one of the main merits of the sequential approach is its flexibility. However, this flexibility comes at the 
cost of theoretical inconsistency.

Title:  Sequential linking of Computable General Equilibrium and microsimulation models: a comparison of behavioural and 
reweighting techniques
Abstract: Several approaches have recently been developed to combine a computable general equilibrium model (CGE) and a 
microsimulation (MS) model. These so-called CGE-MS models enjoy a growing interest because they build a bridge between 
macro- and microeconomic analyses. This paper focuses on the top-down? approach. In this context, the CGE model is used to 
simulate the changes at the macroeconomic level after the policy change, which are then passed on to the MS model. The aim 
of this paper is to compare the top-down? approach introduced by Bourguignon et al. (2003) based on a behavioural MS model 
with an alternative and simpler approach making use of a non-behavioural MS model in combination with a reweighting procedure. 
Both approaches are presented and applications are provided using South African data. We compare the results obtained with both 
approaches for a typical simulation of the impact of trade liberalisation on income distribution. The reweighting approach 
introduces a small bias in the results, however without modifying the main conclusions. This is an indication that, given its 
relative simplicity compared to the behavioural approach, the reweighting approach can constitute a good alternative when data 
or time constraints do not allow the use of the behavioural approach and when the interest does not lie in the production of 
individual-level transition matrices.

Title: Scaling up infrastructure spending in the Philippines: A CGE top-down bottom-up microsimulation approach 
Abstract: In this paper we use a top-down bottom-up CGE microsimulation model with endogenous labour supply and unemployment 
to explore the impact of scaling up infrastructure spending in the Philippines. In the current debate on the importance of 
scaling up infrastructure to stimulate growth, some analysts raise concerns about potential negative macroeconomic impacts 
(Dutch disease). This study aims to provide some insight into this debate by extending the analysis to include distributional 
analysis. We draw from the infrastructure productivity literature to postulate positive productive externalities of new 
infrastructure and from Fay and Yepes (2003) to include operating and maintenance costs associated with new infrastructure. 
We investigate two fiscal tools and foreign aid as mechanisms to fund the new infrastructure and associated costs. 
The distributional analysis is performed with FGT indices and growth incidence curves. Our results reveal that infrastructure 
spending reduces poverty. Foreign aid is shown to be the most equitable funding mechanism, whereas a value added tax provides 
the strongest poverty reduction.

Title: Integrated Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) microsimulation approach 
Abstract: Conventionally, the analysis of macro-economic shocks and the analysis of income distribution and poverty 
require very different methodological techniques and sources of data. Over the last decade however, the natural 
divide between both approaches has diminished, as evaluating the impact of macro-economic shocks on poverty and 
income distribution within a CGE framework complemented by household survey data has flourished. This paper focuses 
on explicitly integrating into a CGE model each household from a nationally representative household survey. 
The aim of this paper is threefold. First, we show that explicitly modelling each household in the CGE model 
addresses Kirmans critique (1992) and overcomes the strong micro-economic assumption of representative agent. 
Second, we respond, albeit in a simple way, to the recommendation of Bourguignon and Perreira (2003) to integrate ?
real? households within a CGE framework rather than using representative households. Third, by providing 
applications to Nepal and the Philippines, we demonstrate that this technique is straightforward to implement and 
requires only a standard CGE model and a nationally representative household survey with information on household 
income and consumption.

Title: Linking CGE and microsimulation models: a comparison of different approaches 
Abstract: In the literature that studies income inequality and poverty, a recent development has been the development of models 
that link together a macroeconomic model (usually a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model) and a microsimulation model. 
Linking the two types of model allows the modeller to take into account full agents? heterogeneity, whilst at the same time 
considering the general equilibrium effects of a proposed policy reform. In this paper, I first review in detail three 
approaches to building linked CGE-microsimulation models: one in accordance with the fully integrated approach, and two 
following the layered approach (the so-called Top-Down and Top-Down/Bottom-Up approaches). The principal goal of the paper is 
to present a considered evaluation of the merits and demerits of these alternative methods currently used to link CGE and 
microsimulation models. To do so I use all three approaches to model the macro- and micro-economic impacts of a policy shock 
to an archetypical economy (constructed using fictitious data), and compare the results. This analysis highlights the 
importance of (i) consistency between the underlying macro- and micro-data; and (ii) the precise mechanisms by which feedback 
effects are passed between the macro and micro models. I develop this latter point further by detailed analysis of the TD/BU 
approach outlined by Savard (2003), leading to a proposed refinement in the way that feedback effects from the micro level of 
analysis are incorporated back into the CGE model.

Title:  Economic growth and income distribution: linking macro-economic models with household survey data at the global level
Abstract: This paper describes in detail the analytical structure of the Global Income Distribution Dynamics (GIDD) model, 
a global macro-micro modelling framework, and provides some examples of its recent applications. GIDD is the first macro-micro 
global simulation model focused on long-term, global growth and distribution dynamics. GIDD has been applied in analyzing the 
effects of multilateral trade liberalization or mitigation of climate change damages, among others. It also explicitly 
considers long term time horizons during which changes in the demographic structure are crucial components of both growth and 
distribution dynamics. The challenges of assessing plausible worldwide distributional implications of growth, large shocks, 
and policy changes are daunting. Although addressing these issues in a macro-micro framework is subject to great uncertainty, 
a clearly superior alternative is not yet available.

Title: Case Study: A gender-focused macro-micro analysis of the poverty impacts of trade liberalization in South Africa 
Abstract:  This case study examines the impacts on poverty and equality of the extended 
trade liberalisation strategy that South Africa has been following since 1994. The paper 
features an integrated CGE microsimulation model with explicit incorporation of non-market 
activities and gender decomposition. This makes it possible to assess the effects of trade 
liberalization on between and within-group poverty, as well as on gender-disaggregated 
household production and leisure. The findings reveal that trade liberalization is 
strongly gender biased against women.

Title: Case Study: The growth and poverty impacts of trade liberalization in Senegal 
Abstract: Most empirical studies find relatively small welfare and poverty impacts of 
trade liberalization, mainly as a result of the static framework generally used, in which 
welfare gains and poverty impacts result solely from a short term reallocation of resources. 
Using Senegal as a case study, we illustrate the results of integrating the growth and 
productivity gain effects of trade liberalization with the resulting long-run impacts on 
welfare and poverty. We show that the distributional impacts between poor and non-poor 
depend upon the specific nature of the trade liberalization policies adopted; and the 
characteristics of the economy in which it occurs. In the Senegalese case, the predicted 
principal beneficiaries of trade liberalization are urban and higher skill workers.

Title: Case Study: Tax reform, income distribution and poverty in Brazil: 
an applied general equilibrium analysis 
Abstract: This case study considers two frequently advocated approaches to reducing 
indirect taxation in Brazil: reduction in taxes on food; reduction in taxes on 
intermediate inputs to agriculture. To asses the effects of both on income distribution 
poverty levels, a bottom-up general equilibrium model of Brazil (TERM-BR) is linked to a 
microsimulation model. It is shown that one of the favoured policies is more poverty 
reducing, the other more income inequality reducing. Perhaps even more importantly, 
the analysis demonstrates that the two policies lead to very different outcomes in terms 
of inter-state transfers; a major political barrier to reform in a federal state.

Title: Case Study: Impacts of trade liberalization on poverty and inequality in Argentina: policy 
insights from a non-parametric CGE Microsimulation analysis 
Abstract: This paper studies the economic, poverty, and income inequality impacts of 
both world and domestic trade reform in Argentina, with a special focus on export taxes. 
Argentina offers an interesting case study as the only large agricultural exporter that 
has, at many points in its history, applied export taxes to several of its agricultural 
products. The paper combines results from a global economy-wide model 
(World Bank?s LINKAGE model), a national CGE model, and microsimulations. 
The results suggest that full liberalization of world trade (including subsidies and 
import taxes, but not export taxes), both for agricultural and non-agricultural goods, 
reduces poverty and inequality in Argentina. However, if only agricultural goods are 
included, indicators for poverty and inequality do not improve and even deteriorate 
somewhat. This is particularly the case if export taxes are eliminated.

Title: Case Study: Welfare and poverty impacts of trade liberalization: 
a dynamic CGE microsimulation analysis 
Abstract: This case study focuses on the application of a dynamic top-down CGE 
microsimulation model of the Bangladesh economy. Specifically, this paper examines 
the macroeconomic, poverty and welfare impacts of complete and unilateral domestic 
trade liberalization in Bangladesh over the last two decades. Two different poverty 
lines for rural and urban households are used, which are endogenously determined by 
the model taking into account the rural and urban Consumer Price Indices (CPIs). 
The results suggests marked differences between the short and long run impacts of 
tariff liberalization. In the short run there are possibilities of reduced welfare and 
increased poverty. However, in the long run, resources are reallocated towards the more 
efficient and expanding sectors, generating positive outcomes in terms of welfare gains 
and poverty reduction.

Title: Case Study: Global economic crisis and poverty in Pakistan 
Abstract: In this case study we adopt a macro-micro framework in order to evaluate the 
impact of the current global crisis on the Pakistan economy. We use a top-down approach 
to combine a static computable general equilibrium model with a microsimulation model. 
Our results suggest that between 2007 and 2009 the poverty headcount ratio is likely to 
have increased by almost 80 percent, from 22 to 40 percentage points. However, our results 
also show that this increase is attributable in part to the fuel and food crisis that 
preceded the financial crisis. Our results also indicate a differential impact, with wage 
increases for farm workers and a decrease in wages for skilled labour.

Title: Methodological Issues in Spatial Microsimulation Modelling for Small Area Estimation 
Abstract: In this paper, some vital methodological issues of spatial microsimulation 
modelling for small area estimation have been addressed, with a particular emphasis 
given to the reweighting techniques. Most of the review articles in small area estimation 
have highlighted methodologies based on various statistical models and theories. However, 
spatial microsimulation modelling is emerging as a very useful alternative means of small 
area estimation. Our findings demonstrate that spatial microsimulation models are robust 
and have advantages over other type of models used for small area estimation. The 
technique uses different methodologies typically based on geographic models and various 
economic theories. In contrast to statistical model-based approaches, the spatial 
microsimulation model-based approaches can operate through reweighting techniques such as 
GREGWT and combinatorial optimization. A comparison between reweighting techniques reveals 
that they are using quite different iterative algorithms and that their properties also 
vary. The study also points out a new method for spatial microsimulation modelling

Title: Pushing It To The Edge: Extending Generalised Regression As A Spatial 
Microsimulation Method 
Abstract: This paper extends a spatial microsimulation model to test how the model 
behaves after adding different constraints, and how results using univariate constraint 
tables rather than multivariate constraint tables compare.
This paper also tests how well non-Capital city households from a survey can estimate 
areas within capital cities. Using all households available in Australian survey means 
that the spatial microsimulation method has more households to choose from to represent 
the constraints in the area being estimated. In theory, this should improve the fit of 
the model. However, a household from another area may not be representative of households 
in the area being estimated. 
We found that, in the case that the estimated statistics is already closely related to 
the benchmarks used, adding a number of benchmarks had little effect on the number of 
areas where estimates couldnt be made, and had little effect on the accuracy of our 
estimates in areas where estimates could be made. However, the advantage of using more 
benchmarks was that the weights can be used to estimate a wider variety of outcome variables.
We also found that more complex bi-variate benchmarks gave better results compared to 
simpler univariate benchmarks; and that using a specific sub-sample of observations from 
a survey gave better results in smaller capital cities in Australia (Adelaide and Perth).

Title: Alignment And Matching In Multi-purpose Household Microsimulations 
Abstract: Household microsimulations are often required to align with deterministic 
projections from other sources. This paper suggests the use of random sampling within 
alignment pools to give one-pass event alignment. An iterative process is suggested for 
alignment of person types, but gives disturbingly high numbers of changes. Type alignment 
may be better done by manually adjusting assumptions to give approximate alignment.
Many forms of matching are needed in household microsimulations. The paper suggests two 
different immediate matching methods - probability-weighted, and best of n. Performance 
measures are derived for these methods, and for two existing batch methods - stochastic 
and order of decreasing difficulty. Probability-weighted matching gave slightly better 
results than best of n and stochastic, and order of decreasing difficulty gave poor 
results. The suggested matching methods may be useful in a wide range of applications.

Title: Validating a dynamic population microsimulation model: Recent experience in Australia 
Abstract: Available published research on microsimulation tends to focus on the results 
of policy simulations rather than upon validation of the models and their outputs. Dynamic 
population microsimulation models, which age an entire population through time for some 
decades, create particular validation challenges. This article outlines some of the issues 
that arise when attempting to validate dynamic population models, including changing 
behaviour, the need to align results with other aggregate official projections, data 
quality and useability. Drawing on recent experience with the construction of the new 
Australian Population and Policy Simulation Model (APPSIM), the article discusses the 
techniques being used to validate this new dynamic population microsimulation model.

Title: Simulating Migration In The Pensim2 Dynamic Microsimulation Model 
Abstract: Modelling migration is fundamentally important to maintaining the appropriate 
population structure in a dynamic microsimulation model. It is particularly important as 
it is faster changing than other demographic processes such as fertility and mortality and 
so can impact upon the structure of the population quickly. In this paper we review methods 
that have been used by other models and describe the choices and methods used in the 
Pensim2 dynamic microsimulation model. In particular we model immigration flows, emigration 
flows and the overseas population. We divide our method into modelling how many migrate 
using external macro data and who emigrates, based upon micro processes.

Title: Techniques for Managing Changes to Existing Simulation Models 
Abstract: In This paper provides guidance for managing the enhancement and maintenance of 
an existing microsimulation model. It focuses on techniques and practices that have been 
developed to maintain Pensim2; the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) dynamic 
microsimulation model that simulates state and private pension entitlement. This guidance 
is appropriate for any type of model. Standard project management techniques and bespoke 
simulation model procedures are explained. This guidance is aimed at new modellers and 
project managers and is particularly relevant for models that are supported by a team, 
rather than an individual. Models are generally used for many years after they are 
launched, so it is essential that strong maintenance procedures and project governance 
structures are put in place. Specifically, this paper includes guidance and examples of 
structured Change Control processes that are used to manage enhancements and fixes to the 
model. The Change Control process includes: defining requirements, estimation, design, 
code reviews, testing/validation, managing multiple modellers changing the same programs 
and the use of development checklists. Structured Release management guidance is also 
included in this paper

Title: A dynamic micro-econometric simulation model for firms 
Abstract:  The firm-based simulation model presented in this paper aims to help practical 
policy making, by providing a tool for analyzing the behavioural effects induced by changes in 
the tax code and for forecasting corporate tax revenues. To achieve this end, one of the key 
innovations adopted in the paper is the use of robust estimation techniques designed to 
ameliorate the undue impact of influential observations.  The simulation results indicate that 
a statutory corporate tax rate reduction does not reduce the effective corporate tax rate to an 
equal extent because firms adjust their behaviour to new tax rules. The simulation also reveals 
that even though the macroeconomic environment is important for the taxes paid by the firm, it 
is not obvious that the effective tax rate for these firms may change because of the changed 
macro conditions.

Title: Microsimulation of Virtual Encounters: 
A New Methodology for the Analysis of Socio-Cultural Cleavages 
Abstract: This paper describes a new methodology for the analysis of socio-cultural conflicts 
in situations where actual conflict information is lacking, but survey data on socio-cultural 
opinions are available. The methodology is based on an innovative combination of three different 
approaches; Social network analysis, microsimulation, and inferential statistics. 
Virtual encounters within and across the borders of countries are simulated by randomly matching 
pairs of persons who answered the same interview questions in the European Values Study 1999/2000, 
but may be supposed to never have met in real life. The results of these encounters are stored 
as a new type of dyadic data record. Among other things, each of these dyadic records contains 
information about the degree of dissent between citizens with regard to various types of 
work-related values such as obedience to superiors, meritocratism, or work ethos. By aggregation 
of these simulated value conflicts it becomes possible to anticipate future conflicts within 
and between groups of natives and immigrants. If conflicts between natives and immigrants are 
stronger than the corresponding conflicts within each of the two groups, a cleavage situation i
s predicted, which often results in a ghettoization of immigrated minorities. By focusing on 
certain categories of immigrants with similar socioeconomic status or age, the analysis can 
further be refined such that it may also be instrumental for conceptualizing new immigration 
policies. This is illustrated through an exploration of the potential consequences of Polish 
migration to Germany.

Title: The siena microsimulation model (sm2) for net-gross conversion of eu-silc income 
variables 
Abstract: In interview surveys collecting information on personal income, the respondents may 
report income amounts as gross or net of taxes and other deductions. These data must be made 
homogenous before use for analysis, especially when undertaking comparisons across population 
groups and countries. The Siena Microsimulation Model (SM2) has been developed as a practical 
tool providing a robust and convenient procedure for the conversion between net and gross forms 
of household income. In this paper we describe the logic and structure of the SM2. Starting from data on household and personal income given in different forms, and on the basis of the prevailing tax regime in a country, the SAS routines of the model are designed to estimate full information on income by component, with a breakdown of gross amounts into taxes, social insurance contributions of various types, and net income. Given this specific purpose, SM2 is not meant to be an alternative to general tax-benefit simulation models, but as a complementary tool which those models can usefully exploit. The usefulness of SM2, of course, goes beyond these specific objectives. The distinguishing feature of SM2 is that it can handle diverse tax-benefit regimes using a common logic and a standard set of procedures making it particularly useful for multi-country comparative application; these are explained in the paper in some detail. The immediate context for the development of SM2 has been the requirements of EU-SILC (EU Statistics on Income and Living Conditions). Recently SM2 has been implemented for Italy 
based on EU-SILC data. The application and some results from it are described. Applications 
have also been developed for France, Spain and Greece.  Selected aspects of these applications 
are illustrated for France and Spain.

Title: Cross-validating administrative and survey datasets through microsimulation 
Abstract: In this paper we cross-validate two sources of data, administrative and sample survey, 
addressing an issue commonly faced by analysts regarding the relative reliability and 
comparability of these two data sources. By way of case study, the paper uses data presently 
available in the Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg. While administrative data extracted from the 
recently implemented Social Security Data Warehouse contains information about the whole 
population of Luxembourg (449,000 observations) in 2003, survey data, extracted from the 
Luxembourg household panel PSELL3/EU-SILC for 2004 (incomes from 2003), provides a representative 
sample of only around 3,600 private households (9,800 individuals) living in Luxembourg. The 
attraction of the survey is the more detailed information it provides on incomes, family 
relationships and other socio-economic dimensions. Our paper first analyzes the advantages and 
limitations of each dataset, before outlining and addressing methodological difficulties 
relating to their cross-validation. Through the cross-validation that follows we conclude that 
the survey database performs reasonably well in capturing the relevant characteristics of the 
resident population and allows analyses with respect to characteristics not found in the 
administrative database, and vice versa. Importantly we find that even if, on average, some 
monetary variables are different in the two datasets, the shapes of the equivalised income 
distributions broadly coincide. Even so, we observe a few important discrepancies at the 
extremes of the curves. Finally, through use of the EUROMOD microsimulation platform, we are 
able to show that the discrepancies observed between these income data sources are insufficient 
to significantly affect the conclusions drawn from analysis of policy alternatives.

Title: Micro simulations on the effects of ageing-related policy measures: The Social Affairs Department of 
the Netherlands Ageing and Pensions Model 
Abstract: his paper describes a newly extended version of the dynamic micro simulation model 
SADNAP (Social Affairs Department of the Netherlands Ageing and Pensions model). SADNAP is being 
developed for calculating the financial and economic implications of the ageing of the 
population and of the ageing-related policy measures that are being proposed to cope with ageing. 
The model uses administrative datasets of Dutch public pension payments and entitlements for 
both public and private pensions. SADNAP has already been in use since 2007 for forecasting the 
state pension expenditures and for analysing the budgetary effects of policy changes. 
The model has been extended in order to give a broader assessment of policy alternatives by 
providing insight into other important evaluation indicators like income redistribution and the 
retirement decision of workers. For the modelling of income redistribution a new micro data 
source with individual data on private pensions is combined with differentiation of mortality 
rates in order to gain a better insight in the income at the individual level within the 
population of pensioners. For the modelling of the retirement decision an option value model is 
developed in which key parameters vary at the individual level in order to benefit from the 
micro simulation approach. These extensions greatly enhance the performance of SADNAP. Besides 
the financial implications, additional insight can now be provided into the effects of policy 
measures on a set of key indicators. 
In this paper both extensions are described in detail and a complete baseline projection of all 
key indicators is discussed.

Title: On the Italian ACE and its impact on enterprise performance: a PLS-path modeling 
analysis 
Abstract: In 1998 Italy introduced a restricted version of an Allowance for 
Corporate Equity, called Dual Income Tax. Using data integrating Italys Institute 
for Statistics enterprise survey data and company accounts, we explore the 
effects of the Dual Income Tax on enterprise performance in 1998-2001. Firms 
benefiting from this allowance are simulated through the DIECOFIS corporate 
tax microsimulation model. The method to estimate enterprise performance is 
based on a structural equation model which allows us to compute a composite 
indicator given specific factors observed from enterprise activity. We find a
positive impact of the Dual Income Tax on enterprise performance in that 
companies benefiting from this allowance outperformed non-eligible ones.

Title: Taxation of closely held corporations  efficiency aspects 
Abstract: This paper investigates two questions regarding closely held 
corporations. First, possible differences between closely and widely held 
corporations are explored. Second, a model is developed to investigate what 
factors and to what extent these factors influence a person to become an 
active owner of a closely held corporation. A background to the first 
question is that profits in closely held corporations in Sweden may be 
taxed as labour income, with a progressive marginal tax, while profits in 
corporations with broad ownership are taxed as capital income, at a flat rate. 
If the expected return after tax is lower in closely held corporations 
compared to corporations with a broad ownership, entrepreneurs and investors 
will demand a higher pre-tax risk-adjusted return. Evidence from Swedish data, 
covering all Swedish corporations, does not seem to reject these hypotheses. 
The model developed to address the second question utilizes extensive individual 
panel data. Some simple simulations are carried out, indicating that changes 
in taxation have important impact on the propensity to become a closely held 
corporation owner. A conclusion is that the tax-system restrains entrepreneurship 
and potentially employment and growth. Some suggestions to improve and expand 
the model are issued. Remaining key questions are e.g. how do changes in the 
tax rules for closely held corporations affect efficiency aspects with 
significance for e.g. employment, government tax revenue and income distribution.

Title: Microsimulation of indirect taxes 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to simulate a tax shift from labour to 
consumption and perform a distributional analysis of the reform. Microsimulation 
programs are often uniquely focussed on the personal income tax system and 
on social security contributions and benefits. However, against a political 
background where income taxes are under increased pressure and alternative, 
less distortive forms of taxation come under consideration, microsimulation 
models enriched with expenditure data and consumption tax structures could 
play an important role in sharpening the (distributional) picture of such 
systemic changes. The current paper discusses an algorithm for this enrichment - 
mainly with VAT, excises and other consumption taxes - within the context of 
the EUROMOD-framework and applies the obtained program to the simulation of 
a decrease of social security contributions compensated by a rise in standard 
VAT rate to maintain government budget neutrality for four EU countries. The 
measure is found to have a (first order) regressive effect, pointing to the 
fact that keeping redistribution constant would require the remaining post-reform 
income taxation to become more progressive.

Title: A care time benefit as a timely alternative for the non-working 
spouse compensation in the Belgian tax system 
Abstract: Over the past decades, the growing labour force participation of 
mothers has rendered the Belgian personal income tax system increasingly 
outdated. Especially the marital quotient system - that allows spouses with 
monetary income to transfer part of their tax base to a spouse without 
monetary income - is no longer a tax allowance that compensates childcare 
efforts. It rather has become a subsidy to older cohorts for their past 
childcare efforts. As an alternative, we model in this article a system that 
is geared towards the effective care trajectories of nowadays parents.  We 
thereby follow earlier ideas of Hilde Bojer, Patricia Apps and Ray Rees to 
reflect care efforts in the tax base of individuals. Following Bojer, we 
propose a system that incorporates a socially grounded amount of childcare 
time in household income, and simulate this with the Belgian microsimulation 
model MISIM. The amount relates to the number and age of children and can 
either be procured through childcare services or self-provision. In the 
proposed system both market- and self-provided care result in a similar 
ubsidy. We elaborate a monetary estimate of self-provided childcare on the 
basis of the detailed information of time use in the Flemish Family and Care 
Survey (2004-2005). For discussion we provide an overview of potential 
drawbacks and advantages and evaluate the redistributive impact of the 
simulated alternative.

Title: Developing a static microsimulation model for the analysis of housing 
taxation in Italy 
Abstract: In this paper we develop the first (static) microsimulation model 
aimed at studying the distributive impact of housing taxation on Italian 
households. We use as input data those provided by the Bank of Italy from 
its Survey on Households Income and Wealth, and discuss specific problems 
arising in the evaluation of cadastral income and of the Property Tax base. 
Our estimates of the distribution of taxpayers are very close to the Ministry 
of Finance official statistics; hence, our model can be seen as a reliable 
tool to evaluate the current distribution of housing taxation and the impact 
of potential tax reforms. Our simulations suggest that both Property Tax and 
Waste Management Tax show a moderate regressive impact with respect to household 
gross income, whilst the Personal Income Tax on dwellings other than the main 
residence is progressive. We then provide an application of our model, to study 
the Property Tax reform in 2008. Our findings show that all households owning 
the main residence gain from the 2008 reform, but tax cuts are mostly 
concentrated on the top three deciles of household equivalent gross income, 
so that the richest benefit most.

Title: Constructing a Basefile for Simulating Kunmings Medical Insurance Scheme of Urban Employees 
Abstract: Focusing on Chinas medical insurance scheme which covers all 
employers and employees in urban areas, this research aims to assess the 
distributional impacts of medical insurance policies and to predict medical 
expenses by using microsimulation techniques. As an important part of the 
project, this article provides a brief overview of Chinas medical insurance 
reform of urban employees and detail the techniques and processes to construct 
a basefile in 2005 for projecting the medical expenditures for urban employees 
over the period of 2006-2010. The main data used are administrative medical 
records of medical insurance participants provided by the Bureau of Labour and 
Social Security of Kunming, Yunnan Province. Along with the initial analysis 
for the raw datasets and age processing and adjustment for the individual 
records, monthly income information was imputed and personal savings accounts 
were established for each individual record. Important modelling parameters 
such as death rates and income adjustment factors were constructed. Furthermore, 
this article identifies medical insurance for government officials by using 
the combination of logarithm curve fitting and binary discriminant analysis. 
Based on this basefile, a static microsimulation model can be built to assess 
the implementation effects of the medical insurance policy and analyse the 
impact of the medical insurance scheme on urban employees.

Title: Challenges and Solutions in Constructing a Microsimulation Model of the Use and Costs of Medical Services in Australia
Abstract: This paper describes the development of a microsimulation model =HealthMod which simulates the use and costs of medical and related services by Australian families. Australia has a universal social insurance scheme known as =Medicare which provides all Australians with access to free or low-cost essential medical services. These services are provided primarily by general practitioners as well as specialist doctors but also include diagnostic and imaging services. Individuals may pay a direct out-of pocket contribution if fees charged for services are higher than the reimbursement schedule set by government. HealthMod is based on the Australian 2001 National Health Survey. This survey had a number of deficiencies in terms of modelling the national medical benefits scheme. The article outlines three major methodological steps that had to be taken in the model construction: the imputation of synthetic families, the imputation of short-term health conditions, and the annualisation of doctor visits and costs. Some preliminary results on the use of doctor services subsidised through Australias Medicare are presented.

Title: Modelling the cost of ill health in Health&WealthMOD (Version II): 
lost labour force participation, income and taxation, and the impact of disease prevention  
Abstract: This paper provides a detailed description of the construction of 
Health&WealthMOD (Version II). It is Australias only microsimulation model of 
health and illness and their impacts on labour force participation, income, wealth 
and government revenue and expenditure. In this paper, we describe Health&WealthMOD 
(Version II) and its architecture, the application of the model, and some of the 
results it has produced.

Title: Projecting the impacts of illness on labour force participation: 
An application of Health&WealthMOD 
Abstract: Health&WealthMOD is the first Australian microsimulation model 
designed to determine the economic impacts of disease on older workers, aged 
45 to 65 years. Chronic health conditions are known to be associated with 
early retirement. This paper describes an application of Health&WealthMOD to 
estimate the impact of this association on projected labour force participation 
to 2020 given the ageing population and long-term trend in chronic conditions. 
Due to ageing and disease trends, the number of people with chronic conditions 
in the 45-64 years age group was expected to rise to about 4.8 million by 2020, 
an increase of 82% from the 2003 population of the same age group. About 
904,000 persons in the 45-64 age group were projected to be out of the labour 
force due to ill health in 2020, when only the ageing and population growth 
were considered. When trends in illness were captured, the figure was increased 
to about 1.2 million persons. This demonstrates that health is a major driver 
of labour force participation and retirement and that economic policies alone, 
with no consideration of health interventions to treat or prevent chronic 
illness, will only have a limited impact on labour force participation. 
Thus, it is important that the government focuses on both health policies and 
economic policies in order to make sure that there will be an adequate supply 
of labour force in future.

Title: Using Statistics Canada LifePaths Microsimulation Model to Project the 
Disability Status of Canadian Elderly
Abstract: Complex population projections usually use microsimulation models; 
in Canada, Statistics Canada has developed a global dynamic microsimulation 
model named LifePaths in the Modgen programming language to be used in policy 
research. LifePaths provides a platform to build on for our research program, 
conjointly with Dr Janice Keefe from Mount Saint Vincent University, on 
projections of the Canadian chronic homecare needs for the elderly up to 2031 
and of the human resources required. Beside marital status, family networks 
and living arrangements, future disability status of the elderly is a key 
variable, but an intricate one. Since disability status transitions were 
previously conditioned only on age and sex, we will use here the current 
disability module of LifePaths with longitudinal data from Canadas National 
Population Health Survey (NPHS). These new disability status transitions are 
considering other significant explicative variables like marital status, 
education etc. We will then present projections of future Canadian elderly by 
disability status and a comparison with nine European countries for the Future 
Elderly Living Conditions in Europe (FELICIE) Research Program which has used 
the same approach. Our previous researches have shown the importance of 
future disability level for the management of an elderly society. The main 
output of the present paper would first produce, with new health scenarios, 
new estimates for Canada of elderly in poor health, for those aged 75 and over. 
Secondly, it would produce an interesting comparative analysis, useful especially 
for implementing new policies for the well-being of the Canadian elderly.

Title: Cost-Benefit Model System of Chronic Diseases in Australia to Assess and 
Rank Prevention and Treatment Options 
Abstract: Chronic diseases - eg heart disease, cancer, diabetes, mental disorders - 
affect around 80% of older Australians, are the main causes of disability and 
premature death, and account for 70% of total health expenditures. Because lifestyle 
patterns are major risk factors, chronic disease prevention and treatment are not 
only of medical concern, but also of considerable social, family-level and personal 
interest. While this makes microsimulation approaches particularly suitable for 
assessing intervention costs and benefits, such approaches will need to be combined 
with disease-progression models if health status and treatment choices are also to 
be simulated.  AIMS: Describe methodological and technical proposals for the 
development of a cost-benefit model-system. METHODS: Several chronic disease 
progression models are to be linked to an Umbrella microsimulation model 
representing the Australian population. To project 20 years ahead, use of 
reweighting techniques are proposed for population projections, disease-specific 
predictions and for health-related projections. The model-system is to account 
simultaneously for Australians demographic, socioeconomic and health-risk-factor 
characteristics; progression of their health status; the number of chronic diseases 
(comorbidities) they accumulate over time; health-related expenditures; and changes 
in quality of life. Standard methods are proposed to estimate costs versus benefits 
of simulated policy interventions and related quality of life improvements. 
KEY OUTCOME: Proposal of novel methods for modelling comorbidities - a task rarely 
attempted, although quality of life is known to decline and health expenditures to 
increase well above what a linear addition of the effects of individual chronic 
diseases would predict.

Title: Economic Modelling of the Prevention of Type 2 Diabetes in Australia  The Diabetes Model 
Abstract: This paper outlines the development of the Diabetes Model which projects 
the number of Australians 25 years of age and over who are expected to have pre 
diabetes and type 2 diabetes over a 45 year simulation period. The model also 
simulates control of the disease in terms of glycaemic levels, cholesterol levels, 
weight and blood pressure control. The model produces a wide range of epidemiological 
and economic outputs to assess the current and projected impact of those with the 
disease. The number and cost of complications associated with type 2 diabetes, 
conditioning on the level of diabetes control, are also projected.
The model also provides the capacity to quantify the effect of hypothetical public 
health initiatives in the management of type 2 diabetes and associated trends in 
risk factor prevalence and diabetes control over the simulation period. While the 
benefits of such programs often will not manifest until many years after 
implementation, the Diabetes Model simulation period enables long term benefits to 
be assessed beyond traditional government planning horizons. By comparing the 
results of the base case status quo projection to alternative simulations premised 
on interventions that either reduce the prevalence of diabetes risk factors or 
improve diabetes control among those known to have the disease, it is possible to 
identify the extent to which short run investments can reap long term benefits in 
both human and economic terms.

Title: The evaluation of health policies through dynamic microsimulation methods 
Abstract: This paper presents an overview of microsimulation as a method to evaluate
health and health care policies and interventions. After presenting a brief survey 
of microsimulation models and applications we describe the main features of the 
approach and how these are implemented in practice. We pay particular attention to 
the innovative features of dynamic microsimulation as a method of ex-ante policy 
evaluation. The final section presents a critical overview of the most recent 
health-dedicated dynamic microsimulation models including POHEM and FEM, two of the 
most comprehensive dynamic microsimulation models for health. We describe how these 
models are used to simulate lifecycle health trajectories and associated health 
care costs under competing policy scenarios to illustrate the power of microsimulation 
as a valid and relevant tool for policy evaluation.

Title: A more efficient sampling procedure, using loaded probabilities 
Abstract: All-case simulation, where demographic outcomes are simulated for each 
person each simulation cycle, has been used in almost every national household 
microsimulation model. This paper suggests the use of simulation by stratified 
sampling with loaded probabilities. This suggestion is intended to provide faster 
simulations, particularly when using simulation cycle times much shorter than a 
year. The paper derives optimal formulas for draw numbers and loaded probabilities, 
and uses stochastic simulations to show that sampling with loaded probabilities 
gives similar results to all-case simulation. Tests with a microsimulation model 
of 175,000 Australians show that sampling with loaded probabilities can reduce run 
times with yearly cycles by about 43%, and run times with weekly cycles by about 
98%. A 50-year demographic projection took 34 seconds with a yearly cycle, and 54 
seconds with a weekly cycle. Event numbers and standard deviations are comparable 
with those expected from risk profiles. The paper concludes that sampling with 
loaded probabilities is theoretically valid, can be much quicker than all-case 
simulation, and does give similar estimates. Potential applications are for large 
models, or those with short simulation cycles.

Title:  A Mate-Matching Algorithm for Continuous-Time Microsimulation Models
Abstract: The timing of partnership formation in closed continuous-time microsimulation 
models poses difficulties due to the continuous time scale. In this paper the 
problem is resolved by the concept of a partnership market, which individuals can 
enter and leave at any point in time over the complete simulation time range. Each 
individual, who looks for a spouse, remains in the market for a specific period 
during which searching and matching is performed. To build up synthetic couples, 
the model imitates a decision making-process. The decision to enter a partnership 
depends on empirically estimated logit models for the probability that a given 
woman and a given man will get together, and also on an individual aspiration 
level regarding a potential partner. A couple is formed if a positive decision has 
been made and the timing of the partnership formation is consistent with the 
individual searching periods of the prospective spouses. The algorithm is 
illustrated by an example in which simulations are run to project a synthetic 
population, similar to the population of the Netherlands, by using an extended 
version of the microsimulation tool of the MicMac project.

Title: Simulating Histories within Dynamic Microsimulation Models 
Abstract: Constructing a base dataset is one of the most important elements in the 
dynamic microsimulation modelling. However, the access to a long historical panel 
is usually restricted for many reasons. This paper aims to develop a back 
simulation method that has the potential to generate a consistent synthetic 
history panel based on a typical household survey dataset with some complementary 
statistics. The model uses Living in Ireland (LII) household survey as an example 
to reconstruct the individual labour market trajectory since 1939. The overall 
results of the simulated panel have been proven sensible and consistent based on 
several validation tests. This method opens the possibility to further investigate 
into several fields of application such as life-cycle income analysis and pension 
reform evaluation, which typically requires the historical profile of individuals 
and has traditionally been difficult to perform.

Title: A Microsimulation Approach to an Optimal Swedish Income Tax 
Abstract:  The purpose of this paper is to identify a Swedish tax/benefit design that
maximizes social welfare. A two stage process is proposed where individuals preferred
choice of leisure and consumption is solved in the first stage, and the second stage
identifies the tax/benefit system that maximizes the social welfare function. 
The study deviates from the mainstream literature as the first stage is based on a 
micro simulation model with estimated behavioural responses. We estimate a structural 
model for a sample of workers or voluntary non-workers that describes heterogeneity 
in consumption-leisure preferences for different household types. Models that describe 
the participation decision for the unemployed as well as individuals outside the labour 
force are also included. The results suggest that increased housing allowance, basic 
deduction, and in-work tax credit in combination with a reduction of the progressive 
national taxes would increase welfare.

Title: Accrued Pension Rights in Belgium: Micro-Simulation of Reforms 
Abstract:  We simulate different reform scenarios of the Belgian pension system using 
a micro-simulation approach. Using a rich administrative dataset with extensive 
information on individual earnings histories, we evaluate the impact of the scenarios 
for the individuals as well as the system as a whole. Our main metric for these 
analysis is the notion of accrued to date pension rights, i.e. the pensions rights 
that would be due if the system were shut down today and all accrued rights under 
current legislation were honoured. Our analysis illustrates that partial reforms have 
limited effects, both in distributional and in fiscal terms. To achieve more substantial 
effects, a more comprehensive approach is needed. Regional differences within the 
country are mostly due to differences in regional GDP rather than the pension system itself.

Title:  Linking a Microsimulation Model to a Dynamic CGE Model: Climate Change 
Mitigation Policies and Income Distribution in Australia
Abstract:  This paper extends the top-down framework developed by Robilliard et al. 
(2001) to link a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model to a microsimulation (MS) 
model. The proposed approach allows for the linking of an MS model to a dynamic 
(rather than static) CGE model. The approach relies on altering the sample weights in 
order to reproduce long-term population projections and changes in employment as 
estimated by the CGE model. The approach is applied to assess the effects of 
climate-change mitigation policies in Australia from 2005 to 2030 at five-yearly 
intervals.

Title:  On weights in dynamic-ageing microsimulation models
Abstract:  A dynamic model with cross-sectional dynamic ageing builds up complete synthetic 
life histories for each individual, starting from a survey dataset or an administrative 
dataset. Many of these datasets include weights. This is a problem for dynamic microsimulation 
models, since the most obvious solution, expanding the dataset, is not always advisable 
or even possible. This short paper presents an alternative method to use weights in 
dynamic microsimulation models with dynamic ageing. This approach treats the weighting 
variable as just another variable in the model, and the weights are only used after 
simulation to derive weighted simulation results. Tests using Australian data confirm 
that weighted variables give sensible results, with reductions in runtimes and memory 
requirements.

Title:  MIKMOD-ESt: A Static Microsimulation Model of Personal Income Taxation in Germany
Abstract: MIKMOD-ESt is a microsimulation model of the German personal income tax. 
Developed and operated on behalf of the German Federal Ministry of Finance, MIKMOD-ESt 
is extensively used to evaluate numerous proposals for reforms of personal income 
taxation in Germany. The aim of this paper is to shed light on various aspects of the 
model. These include information on the microdata used for simulation (source and date,
differences to other data sets) as well as the method for updating and uprating the 
data. Based on these information, advantages in comparison to other existing tax(-benefit) 
models  as well as limitations of the current simulation model are discussed. 
Advantages are, e.g. the full inclusion of all taxpayers above a certain income 
threshold by using official tax returns or the possibility to conduct microsimulation 
analyses in a very detailed manner that allows for evaluation of very small and 
selective reforms. The main constraints are the restriction of the database to those 
currently obliged to file a tax return and the lack of information necessary to model 
the behavioural responses to tax changes.

Title: Tax-benefit systems, income distribution and work incentives in the European Union 
Abstract: In this paper we study the impact of tax-benefit systems on income inequality and work incentives across the 27 Member States of the European Union (EU). 
Using EUROMOD, the EU-wide tax-benefit microsimulation model, we disentangle the role of taxes, benefits and social insurance contributions in influencing country 
specific Gini coefficients and Marginal Effective Tax Rates. The extent to which tax-benefit systems contribute to income redistribution and provide work incentives 
at the intensive margin is found to vary considerably across the 27 Member States of the EU. Our results further highlight the presence of a trade-off between income 
redistribution and work incentives across EU-27 countries.

Title:  Towards a European Union Child Basic Income? Within and between country effects
Abstract: This paper explores the within and between country distributional implications of an illustrative Child Basic Income (CBI) operated at EU level. 
Using EUROMOD, we establish that a universal payment of 50 per month per child aged under 6 could take 800,000 children in this age group out of poverty. 
It could be financed by an EU flat tax of 0.2% on all household income, assuming that it would also be taxed nationally as income. 
Most member states and virtually all families with children aged under 6 would be net gainers. We simulate two versions of EU CBI, with the benefit rate of 50 per month 
adjusted or not for differences in purchasing power between member states. In general, fiscal flows between member states, and also poverty reduction, would be 
smaller under the adjusted version. The political feasibility of such a scheme might be questioned, especially within the net contributor countries. Nevertheless, for those 
seeking ways to strengthen solidarity across national boundaries, a scheme supporting the incomes of families with young children, wherever in the EU they might reside 
could be a demonstration of the EUs commitment to children, to the future (EC 2012a: 62).

Title:  The importance of choosing the data set for tax-benefit analysis
Abstract:  Given the increased availability of survey income data, in this paper we analyse the pros and cons of alternative data sets for static tax-benefit 
microsimulation in Italy. We focus on all possible alternatives, namely using (a) SHIW or (b) IT-SILC data using a consistent net-to-gross microsimulation model, 
or (c) IT-SILC data using the gross incomes provided since 2007. Our results suggest that IT-SILC improves in the regional representativeness of the Italian 
population and does not perform worse than SHIW as for most demographic characteristics, SHIW provides more information regarding building and real estate incomes. 
Gross income variables simulated by using the net-to-gross module included in the TABEITA microsimulation model and calibrating for tax evasion provide a very precise 
fit with external statistics. Simulated IT-SILC gross income data fit external aggregate data even better than gross income data provided in IT-SILC, which tend to largely 
overestimate self-employment income. Finally, we suggest to match IT-SILC with SHIW to include in the former the information on building and real estate incomes that 
are contained only in the latter. This allows us to reach a very satisfactory validation of the final data set.

Title: Impact assessment of alternative reforms of Child Allowances using RUSMOD  the static tax-benefit microsimulation model for Russia 
Abstract:  RUSMOD is a static tax-benefit microsimulation model for Russia. The model can be used for ex post and ex ante evaluation of reforms of personal 
income taxation and social benefits in Russia. In addition, being compatible with EUROMOD, the Russian model is suitable for simulation of cross-country policy transfers. 
The aim of this paper is to shed light on various aspects of the model. It discusses specific problems arising in the evaluation of unreported income and benefits 
non-take up in Russia. The final estimates of poverty and inequality from RUSMOD are very close to those based on National accounts; hence, the model can be seen as 
a reliable tool for evaluating the current performance of the Russian tax-benefit system and the distributive impact of potential tax-benefit reforms. Then the paper 
provides an example of application of the model  an analysis of alternative scenarios for improving the design of child allowances in Russia. Currently, this benefit 
has a poor targeting performance and varies across regions of Russia in terms of design and generosity, which raises serious equity concerns. Redirecting these resources 
to the poor  by means of better targeting and raising the benefit amounts  brings about significant improvements in overall and child poverty indicators even at the 
current level of spending. The most sizable impact on poverty is achieved by implementing the unified national design of the program.

Title:  Improving work incentives in Serbia: evaluation of a tax policy reform using SRMOD
Abstract:  Inactivity and unemployment rates as well as informal employment rates in Serbia are particularly high among low-paid workers. Several studies argued that 
one of main reasons for high entry costs in the labour market in Serbia is the existence of the mandatory minimum base for social security contributions (SSC). 
Our paper is the first one to provide empirical evidence about the incentive and distributional effects of the abolishment of the mandatory minimum SSC base. 
Using the tax and benefit micro-simulation model for Serbia (SRMOD), which is based on EUROMOD platform, we found that this policy reform would reduce effective 
average tax rates by more than it would reduce effective marginal tax rate. This implies a larger participation response than hours-of-work response. A decrease 
in both of these indicators is most pronounced for lower income groups. At the same time, the reform would trigger positive distributional effects since the number 
of individuals in low-income groups, whose disposable income would increase after the reform by more than 2%, is ranging from 3.3% to 5.8%. However, the impact of 
the reform on the overall level of inequality, measured by the Gini coefficient, would be small.

Title: A survey of dynamic microsimulation models: uses, model structure and methodology
Abstract:  More than 10 years ago ODonoghue (2001a) surveyed the dynamic microsimulation models that had been developed up to that point. 
However many of the barriers mentioned have been gradually overcome in the last decade . This paper surveys the development and practices in dynamic 
microsimulation over the past decade, and discusses the methodological challenges today.
It provides an overview of the methodological choices made in more than 60 known dynamic microsimulation models and examines the advantages and disadvantages
of different practices. In addition, this paper reviews the main progress made in the field and explores how future microsimulation models could evolve
potentially.

Title: Modelling Household Spending Using a Random Assignment Scheme
Abstract: Applied demand analysis is usually done by specifying some kind of econometric equation but there are some difficulties associated with this 
approach. These include the problem of modelling at a highly disaggregated level and the amount of data needed to estimate the parameters for the equations.
This paper examines the use of what are known as random assignment schemes as a way to model household expenditure. This approach is based on the idea of 
predicting the behavioural response of a microsimulation unit by finding a donor, which is in some sense similar to the receiving unit.
The paper begins with a brief review of econometric modelling. It then introduces the principles of random assignment schemes. 
These are expanded upon in an illustrative example to model the effect of changes in the level of income on household expenditure patterns. The model is then 
used as a platform to show how the random assignment scheme can be used to model a large number of goods, at the level of individual households.

Title: Modelling Private Wealth Accumulation and Spend-down in the Italian Microsimulation Model CAPP_DYN: A Life-Cycle Approach
Abstract: In microsimulation literature a limited number of models include a module aimed at analyzing and projecting the evolution of private wealth over time.
However, this issue appears crucial in order to comprehensively evaluate the likely distributional effects of institutional reforms adopted to cope with 
population ageing. In this work we describe the implementation in the Italian dynamic micro simulation model CAPP_DYN of a new module in which households 
savings and asset allocation are modelled. In particular, we aim to account for possible behavioural responses to pension reforms in household savings. 
To this end, we rely on an approximate life cycle structural framework for estimating saving behaviour, while adopting a traditional stochastic micro simulation 
approach for asset allocation. In line with Ando and Nicoletti Altimari (2004), we emphasize the role of lifetime economic resources in households consumption 
decisions, yet we further account for internal habit formation and subjective expectations on pension outcomes in the econometric stage. In addition, 
we model intergenerational transfers of private wealth in a probabilistic fashion. 
As the behavioural hypothesis adopted can largely affect results, we compare our semi-structural life-cycle approach with the estimation and the simulation of 
a non-structural consumption rule, analyzing wealth and disposable income dynamics and their drivers according to the two methods, especially in a long-term 
intergenerational perspective.
While a 'quasi' life cycle consumption profile, including saving responses to pension reforms, curbs the dynamics of wealth inequality compared to the 
non-structural approach, results for the period 2010-2050 suggest an increasing contribution of intergenerational transfers to the predicted increase in 
wealth dispersion. Although hypotheses on (the mean of) returns are neutral for the evolution of net wealth inequality, the differential between returns and 
productivity (r-g) parameters are crucial in affecting the dynamics of disposable income due to cumulated effect on capital incomes shares.

Title:  Taxation of Married Couples in Germany and the UK: One-Earner Couples Make the Difference
Abstract: A large body of literature points out that joint taxation of married couples with full income splitting (Ehegattensplitting) is an important 
for the relatively low labor force participation of married women in Germany. This paper investigates the relative gains of joint taxation for married couples 
by comparing effective tax burdens for three groups of tax units between Germany and the UK. Using the tax and benefit microsimulation model, EUROMOD, we 
compare effective average income tax rates for singles, one-earner couples, and two-earner couples in Germany and the UK. Applying the concept of effective 
tax rates, we go beyond marginal tax rates and account for effects of tax allowances and tax exemptions. We find that effective income tax liabilities are 
significantly lower for the majority of tax units in Germany compared to the UK, in particular for married couples. This is because married couples are taxed 
jointly in Germany, whereas the spouses are taxed individually in the UK. The benefits of joint taxation are particularly important for one-earner couples, and
they can be found along almost the entire income distribution.

Title:  A new equilibrium simulation procedure with discrete choice models
Abstract: Many microeconometric models of discrete choice include alternative-specific constants meant to account for (possibly besides other factors) the 
density or accessibility of particular types of alternatives. A notable area of application is labour supply, where for example part-time jobs vs. full-time 
jobs might be more or less accessible. The most common use of these models is the simulation of tax-transfer reforms. The simulation is usually interpreted as a 
comparative statics exercise, i.e. the comparison of different equilibria induced by different policy regimes. The simulation procedure, however, typically keeps 
fixed the estimated alternative-specific constants. In this note we argue that this procedure is not consistent with the comparative statics interpretation. Since
the constants reflect the number of jobs and since the number of people willing to work changes as a response to the change in tax-transfer regime, the new 
equilibrium induced by the reform implies that the constants should also change. A structural interpretation of the alternative-specific constants leads to the 
development of a simulation procedure consistent with the comparative statics interpretation. The procedure is illustrated with a simulation of alternative 
reforms of the income support policies in Italy.

Title:  Testing the Statistical Significance of Microsimulation Results: A Plea
Abstract: In the microsimulation literature, it is still uncommon to test the statistical significance of results. In this article we argue that this situation 
is both undesirable and unnecessary. Provided the parameters used in the microsimulation are exogenous, as is often the case in static microsimulation of the 
first-order effects of policy changes, simple statistical tests can be sufficient. Moreover, standard routines have been developed which enable applied researchers 
to calculate the sampling variance of microsimulation results, while taking the sample design into account, even of relatively complex statistics such as relative 
poverty, inequality measures and indicators of polarization, with relative ease and a limited time investment. We stress that when comparing simulated and baseline 
variables, as well as when comparing two simulated variables, it is crucial to take account of the covariance between those variables. Due to this covariance, 
the mean difference between the variables can generally (though not always) be estimated with much greater precision than the means of the separate variables.

Title:  A Review of Spatial Microsimulation Methods
Abstract: This paper outlines a framework for spatial microsimulation models, gives some reasons why someone may want to use a spatial microsimulation model, describes the
development of spatial microsimulation over the last 30 years, summarises the different methods currently used for spatial microsimulation, and outlines how the models can be validated.
In reviewing the reasons and methods for spatial microsimulation, we conclude that spatial microsimulation provides an alternative to other small area estimation methods, providing
flexibility by allowing cross-tabulations to be built, and an ability to link to other models, and derive projections. Spatial microsimulation models also allow 
demographic changes, like births and deaths, to be included in a dynamic microsimulation model. This also allows what if scenarios to be modelled, for example, what would happen if the birth rate increased over time.
Validation of the spatial microsimulation models shows that they are now at the stage where they can provide reliable result

Title:  Spatial Microsimulation Modelling: a Review of Applications and Methodological Choices
Abstract: Spatial microsimulation modelling has developed for over a half century and is now a mainstream analytical tool within the microsimulation community 
accounting for a very significant proportion of papers at conferences and within the journal. There have been a number of recent surveys of mainstream spatial 
microsimulation models and associated methodologies. The contribution of this paper relates mainly in extending these surveys by considering other micro based 
simulation models that incorporate a spatial or geographic dimension. We feel this is important as in many areas of microsimulation modelling, there are 
parallel literatures that have developed that apply simulation techniques to micro units that are not labelled microsimulation or in the case of the papers 
reviewed in this paper not labelled spatial microsimulation. The paper reviews a number of different application areas of spatially focused microsimulation models,
including demography, welfare, health, regional development, transport planning, agri-environmental analysis, crisis planning, land use and planning. We also 
review a number of the methodological choices made by modellers including scope, and spatial disaggregation, data sources, data creation methodology, validation 
and calibration and simulating change

Title:  Comparing Two Methods of Reweighting a Survey File to Small Area Data
Abstract: One method of calculating small area estimates using survey data involves deriving new weights for
each respondent in the survey. These new weights are derived so that the survey data sums to some known totals for a small area (from either a Census 
or administrative data). There are different methods for calculating these weights, and this paper analyses the results from two different methods - a generalised 
regression method and combinatorial optimisation. The weights derived from each method are compared, and advantages and disadvantages of each
method are assessed. Estimates of housing stress at a Statistical Local Area in Australia from each method are then calculated, and these estimates are then 
validated against a third reliable source, Australian Census data from 2001.

Title:  Modelling the impact of declining Australian terms of trade on the spatial distribution of income
Abstract: Macroeconomic shocks such as movements in exchange rates or the terms of trade not only affect the overall economy but also affect different areas 
in a country in different ways, thus creating a spatial distribution of the shock. The effect on some regions is often larger than the national effect as 
regions differ in terms of resource endowments, economic activities, physical and human capital. The standard national CGE-Microsimulation framework is a useful
approach to capture the distributional impacts of macro shocks on households at national and state and territory levels. However, the CGE-Microsimulation framework 
does not capture the distributional impact of a policy change or an external shock on small geographical areas of interest. To overcome this limitation, this 
paper extends the framework by linking a spatial microsimulation model to the national CGE-microsimulation framework in a top-down manner
to capture the distribution of income in small areas of a macro shock. We simulate a potential decline in Australian terms of trade over 2012-13 to 2017-18 and 
find significant differences in the spatial distribution of the impacts of the shock.

Title:  Constructing an Urban Microsimulation Model to Assess the Influence of Demographics on Heat Consumption
Abstract: We present ongoing work on the construction of a spatial microsimulation model
to assess the influence of demographics on residential heat consumption for Hamburg, Germany.
Demographics are important for urban energy planning as: (1) Buildings are becoming more energy-efficient and building occupant behaviour accounts for 
a growing share in the variation of consumption; (2) building occupant needs are changing along with demographic change; and (3) the share of small 
decentralized district heating grids, in which fewer customers mean less averaging out of heterogeneous occupant profiles, is set to play a bigger role 
in the countrys heat supply. We construct a spatial microdata set for the city of Hamburg (of roughly 1.8 million inhabitants and 370 000 buildings), with 
households populating geo-referenced buildings, in three steps: (a) Synthesizing the population of small scale statistical areas, comprising up to around 2000 
people (we do this by selecting households recorded in the German microcensus and fitting them into the statistical areas); (b) assigning energy relevant 
properties to the geo-reference buildings from the Hamburg digital cadaster (we do this by making use of a well-established building typology developed for 
energy assessment) and constructing dwelling units in these buildings; and (c) matching households to the dwelling units in these buildings (which we do again 
by using household data from the microcensus). This last stepallocating households to buildingsmay be the most interesting and challenging task. As of to date, 
we use a combinatorial optimization algorithm to achieve this. Once we have a microsimulation model of buildings and households living in them, including their 
demographic composition, the range of questions that can be explored is immense. The illustration presented here is a simple heat balance computation of 
individual buildings, using the constructed socio-demographic data and the digital cadaster data as input parameters.

Title:  Microsimulation Model Projecting Small Area Populations Using Contextual Variables: An Application to the Montreal Metropolitan Area, 2006-2031
Abstract: A common difficulty faced when projecting small area populations has to do with the implementation of local factors which highly influence local 
population growth. This problem is particularly important when simulating events that have a strong geographic component, such as internal migration, 
and destination choice of external migrants. This paper is part of a larger research program that aims at developing a dynamic time-based microsimulation 
projection model of the population of the Montreal metropolitan area and its 79 municipalities, by age, sex, and language. It presents an innovative treatment 
of migration by taking into consideration previous changes in local conditions when determining mobility and destination choices.
Municipalities are first divided into two categories, suburban and the central city, to compute location-specific probabilities of moving by age, 
anguage and place of birth. Then, the destination choice of movers is based on a utility function that accounts for five important determinants of residential 
choice (1) the distance from the central city, (2) the current size of the population of each municipality, (3) the municipality development potential, 
(4) the linguistic composition of its population, and (5) the geographical location.
A similar function is estimated to allocate a place of residence to external migrants. Parameters are estimated using conditional logistic regressions and 
are implemented into the microsimulation model. The model is validated over the 2006-2011 period and results of the reference scenario presented for 2031.

Title:  Imputing Individual Effects in Dynamic Microsimulation Models. An application to household formation and labour market participation in Italy
Abstract: Dynamic microsimulation modelling involves two stages: estimation and forecasting. Unobserved heterogeneity is often considered in estimation, but not in forecasting, 
beyond trivial cases. Non-trivial cases involve individuals that enter the simulation with a history of previous outcomes. We show that the simple solutions of attributing to 
these individuals a null effect or a random draw from the estimated unconditional distributions lead to biased forecasts, which are often worse than those obtained neglecting 
unobserved heterogeneity altogether. We then present a first implementation of the Rank method, a new algorithm for assigning individual effects to the simulation sample. 
Out-of-sample validation of our model shows that use of the Rank method significantly improves the quality of the forecasts.

Title: A General Microsimulation Model for the EU VAT with a specific Application to Germany 
Abstract: The major sales tax in the EUand in several other countriesis practiced as value-added tax of the consumption type with invoice method. Literature on microsimulation 
models for VAT is rare, though the importance of VAT has continuously increased. We discuss the issues of VAT-MSM in detail and develop a basic general VAT-MSM, applicable to 
the EU member states (and beyond). To illustrate the functioning of the general model, we apply it in detail to the specific case of Germany. We provide comprehensive estimation 
results for the distributional and fiscal effects of the German VAT. Finally, we simulate the effects of a small VAT reform, comparing static and behavioral response simulations.

Title: Health&WealthMOD2030: A Microsimulation Model of the Long Term Economic Impacts of Disease Leading to Premature Retirements of Australians Aged 45-64 Years Old. 
Abstract: Policymakers in Australia, like in most OECD countries, have recognised the importance of early retirement due to ill health on individuals and families, as well as on 
the budget balance when planning for the health needs of an ageing population. In order to understand these effects, a unique microsimulation model, called Health&WealthMOD2030, 
was built to estimate the impacts of early retirement due to ill health on labour force participation, personal and household income, economic hardship (poverty), and government 
taxation revenue, spending and GDP in the years 2010, 2015, 2020, 2025 and 2030. This paper describes the construction of Health&WealthMOD2030. The model captures the long term 
projections of demographic change, changing labour force participation patterns, real wages growth and trends in major illnesses affecting the older working age population. The 
base population of Health&WealthMOD2030 are the individuals aged 45-64 years with information on their work force status and health from the Australian Bureau of Statistics 
Surveys of Disability, Ageing and Carers (SDAC) 2003 and 2009. Projected estimates of income, taxation, income support payments, savings and superannuation from the National 
Centre for Social and Economic Modelling (NATSEMs) dynamic microsimulation model Australian Population and Policy Simulation Model (APPSIM) were synthetically matched with the 
base population. Health&WealthMOD2030 project forward the economic impacts of early retirement from ill health to 2030. This will fill substantial gaps in the current Australian 
evidence of health conditions that will keep older working age Australians out of the labour market over the long-term.

Title: A Geospatial Dynamic Microsimulation Model for Household Population Projections
Abstract: Forecasting Populations (FPOP) is a microsimulation model (MSM) that is the demographic core of an extensible modeling framework. The framework, with FPOP at its core, 
enables the geospatial projection of a population under purely demographic processes or under the additional influence of exogenous factors such as disease, policy changes and 
prevention programs, or environmental stressors. Empirically-derived transition probabilities of life events such as birth, death, marriage, divorce and migration, captured in 
lookup table format, drive the simulation. These transition probabilities can be modified dynamically by external user-defined functions or other external MSMs. The use of MSM 
structures and methodologies enables FPOP to portray the impact of heterogeneity in the geospatial dimension (e.g., distribution of environmental factors or distribution of 
intervention programs), as well as the social dimension (e.g., household or social network correlates), on the projections. POP is designed and structured to: enable linking 
with external MSMs of any kind; support inclusion or configuration of more detailed transition probabilities; be scalable to millions of agents; use either an existing baseline 
synthetic population or a custom synthetic population of the users design; and, run under computing environments that dont require a high degree of specialized software or 
hardware. In this paper we describe the design and structure of FPOP and then apply FPOP first under purely demographic processes and, secondly, in conjunction with an external 
disease model of obesity.The objective of FPOP is to provide a demographically realistic projection of the size, structure, and movement of populations and households decades 
into the future.

Title:  The MicSim Package of R: An Entry-Level Toolkit for Continuous-Time Microsimulation
Abstract: High entry barriers might discourage many social scientists from using existing microsimulation software. This article presents the 
functionality and capabilities of the free and open source R package MicSim which allows performing continuous-time microsimulation at a very fine-grained 
level from a low level entry point. Hence, the package might also be of interest to people who are new to R. The package implements a generic microsimulation 
model for a wide range of demographic applications. Its central device is the individual life-course, which is defined by the sequence of states the individual 
visits over time and the intervals between the transitions from one state to another. The MicSim model is by design a discrete-event simulation model in which 
a demographic event implies a change in the state of an individual. The considered population is open and life-courses are specified to evolve along three 
continuous time scales: individual age, calendar time, and the time that an individual has already spent in the current state. The stochastic model of the 
microsimulation is parameterized with a base population, transition rates, and (if applicable) a population of migrants. Besides stochastic events, the package 
allows specifying deterministic events such as enrollment of children in elementary school. Example applications illustrate the capabilities of the package.

Title:  Editorial Volume 7(3) 
Abstract: While the direct costs of mortality to the health care system are known to be significant, there is less information regarding the wider economic 
impacts of mortality including the implications for productivity, household incomes and government revenue. This paper outlines the development of LifeLossMOD, 
a new microsimulation model to estimate the economic impacts of premature mortality in Australia. The model is based on a census of 2003 mortality records and 
applies projections from the APPSIM microsimulation model to estimate the counterfactual lifetime trajectories forgone to the year 2030. We estimated that 
mortality in 2003 accounted for over 280,000 full time working years lost to the Australian economy. Future applications of LifeLossMOD will explore the 
distributional impacts of mortality on employment, GDP, government revenue and household income, wealth and retirement savings. These estimates will allow 
decision makers and others to more accurately determine the full economic impacts of mortality by cause. In addition, the model will be able to quantify the 
financial gains likely to accrue with preventative health care interventions, which can in turn be reported on in cost effectiveness analyses.

Title:  A Microsimulation Model to evaluate Italian Households Financial Vulnerability 
Abstract: We build a microsimulation model to monitor the financial vulnerability of Italian households. 
Starting from household-level data from the Survey on Household Income and Wealth and matching them with macroeconomic forecasts on debt and income, 
we project the future path of households indebtedness and debt-service ratio. This allows us to assess households vulnerability at a higher frequency and in 
a more timely manner than by using household data alone. We find that the share of vulnerable households (defined as those with a debt-service ratio below 30 
per cent and income below the median) over the total population is projected to be about stable between 2012 and 2014, with a slight decrease in 2015 due to 
positive income growth. Their debt is also projected to decrease in those years. Overall, we find that the dynamics of income growth are the main driver of 
households vulnerability.

Title:  Spot On or Way Off? Validating Results of the AVID Microsimulation Model Retrospectively
Abstract: A well-known challenge for developers and users of dynamic microsimulation models is the question of credibility, the so-called black box problem. Several strategies have been proposed to validate models. They typically involve comparing the results of a simulation run to other suitable figures. This paper approaches the issue after a considerable time lag and uses empirical data for a retrospective comparison. The validation is concerned with the German AVID model, or more precisely, with the basic employment histories module of the model. The model uses survey data and process-generated data on app. 12 000 Germans to project future employment histories and future old age incomes. After seven years the original respondents were surveyed again so that it is possible to compare their simulated and empirical employment histories. Several aspects regarding desired properties of the simulation results and the characteristics of employment histories are discussed. They include global indicators like cross-sections on the aggregate level, cumulative values on the individual level, and structural indicators on the individual level. The results of the comparison are generally encouraging. On the aggregate and cumulative level there is a very good resemblance. Substantial deviations are only found on the individual, structural level: The empirical employment histories are much more continuous than the simulated ones. This overestimation of complexity can be explained by the developments in the time period used for the estimation of the model parameters, but it still leads to a general underestimation of social inequality in the simulation results.

Title: Data and Model Cross-validation to Improve Accuracy of Microsimulation Results: Estimates for the Polish Household Budget Survey
Abstract: We conduct detailed analysis of the Polish Household Budget Survey data for the years 2006-2011 with the focus on its representativeness from the point of view of microsimulation analysis. We find important discrepancies between the aggregate data weighted with baseline grossing-up weights and official statistics from other sources. A number of re-weighting exercises is examined from the point of view of the accuracy of microsimulation results. We show that using a combination of variables from the data together with a small number of outcomes from the microsimulation model substantially improves the correspondence of simulation results and administrative data. While demographic re-weighting is neutral from the point of view of income distribution, calibrating the weights to adjust for income sources and tax identifiers significantly increases income inequality. We specify a number of factors which ought to be considered in the choice of weight calibration targets. Data re-weighting can substantially improve the accuracy of microsimulation but it should be used with caution.

Title: Microsimulation of Language Dynamics in a Multilingual Region with High Immigration
Abstract: In high immigration countries, linguistic integration to the host society may constitute an important economic, social and political issue. This is likely to be even more salient in countries where two or more languages are already competing. Canada is an officially bilingual country characterized by a low fertility and a high immigration regime. This paper describes a dynamic microsimulation model projecting the population of Canada and its regions by mother tongue and language used at home. Emphasis is put on the language module of the model which allows for changes in language characteristics, namely intergenerational changes in mother tongue and intragenerational changes in home language. Mother tongue and home language are then projected for different scenarios in order to investigate the impact of changes in levels and linguistic composition of immigration. Different hypothesis with regard to language preferences of immigrants (which may be influenced through language management legislation) are also taken into account. Results are presented for two regions, the province of Quebec and the rest of Canada at the horizon 2051 as well as for the stable population. Projection results show that the population of non-official mother tongues will increase rapidly to reach 31% in 2051. More interestingly, the results show that the increase in home language is less important due to language shifts. Since these are more favourable to English than French, the ratio of English speakers to French speakers is increasing both in Québec and in the rest of Canada, thus shifting the equilibrium between official languages

Title: The simulation properties of microsimulation models with static and dynamic ageing  a brief guide into choosing one type of model over the other
Abstract: To assess possible distribution effects of alternative scenarios, including hypothetical future states, one can use either static ageing techniques, which age the population by reweighing and uprating, or dynamic ageing, which alter the relevant population by applying deterministic probabilities that a certain event may or may not occur. This paper makes the argument that, even though the two methods are technically completely different, they are not unlike in terms of their simulation properties. Starting from the thesis that under theoretical circumstances, both approaches are equivalent in terms of their simulation properties, the choice between the two archetypes of models comes down to assessing how far the actual and theoretical circumstances differ from each other. By highlighting the differences and resemblances between static and dynamic microsimulations in terms of their simulation properties, this short note will contribute to the debate in choosing between these two types of models, and can thus serve as an advice piece for someone contemplating the development of a microsimulation model

Title: Endogenizing take-up of social assistance in a microsimulation model. A case study for Germany
Abstract: Microsimulation studies typically assume that all entitlements to means-tested benefits are actually claimed by eligible households, despite a large body of research that suggests that take-up rates are substantially below 100%. The assumption of full take-up tends to exaggerate the simulated increase in caseloads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform. This paper investigates the impact of non-take-up for two hypothetical scenarios, namely increasing and decreasing the base amount of social assistance in Germany by 100 per month. We find a substantial effect of considering non-take-up on the simulated change in fiscal costs and in particular on the change in caseloads, where
the full take-up assumption exaggerates the latter change by a factor of about two.

Title: Modelling the Early life-course (MELC): A Microsimulation Model of Child Development in New Zealand
Abstract: To understand the factors upon which policies can be devised to improve the lives of children and young people, we have developed a dynamic discrete-time micro-simulation model called Modelling the early life-course (MELC). MELC models child development from birth through to age 13, encompassing changes in material and family circumstances, family functioning and early education.  MELC focusses on three main outcomes: health service use, early literacy, and conduct problems. A synthetic base population (n=10,000) derived from the 2006 New Zealand Census is used, and transitions through the life-course are determined from estimates derived by analysing three New Zealand child cohort studies: the Christchurch Health and Development Study, the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study, and the Pacific Islands Families Study. The model has been validated against New Zealand norms for reading, general practitioner visits and hospital admissions. Three scenarios were demonstrated. First, we tested the impact of a number of putatively important factors on early literacy, and found small effects. Second, we found that halving the prevalence of single parenting reduced the prevalence of conduct problems. Third, we changed a number of material and family factors for M?ori, Pacific and low-socio-economic groups to be equal to those for the general population, and found that this produced small improvements in reading, but large reductions in conduct problems for these groups. 
MELC has been deployed as a user friendly desktop application at a number of New Zealand government agencies, where it can be used to test policy-relevant scenarios.

Title: Regression-Style Models for Parameter Estimation in Dynamic Microsimulation: An Empirical Performance Assessment
Abstract: Microsimulation models seek to represent real-world processes and can generate extensive amounts of synthetic data. The parameters that drive the data generation process are often estimated by statistical models, such as linear regression models. There are many models that could be considered for this purpose. We compare six potential models, discuss the assumptions of these models, and perform an empirical assessment that compares synthetic data simulated from these models with observed data. We chose six regression-style models that can be easily implemented in standard statistical software: an ordinary least squares regression model with a lagged dependent variable, two random effects models (with and without an autoregressive order 1within-unit error structure), a fixed effects model, a hybrid model combining features from both fixed and random effects models, and a dynamic panel model estimated with system generalised method of moments. The criterion for good performance was the proximity of fit of simulated data to the observed data on various characteristics. We found evidence of violated assumptions in our data for all the models but found that, for the majority of data characteristics assessed, all the models produced synthetic data that were a reasonable approximation to the observed data, with some models performing better or worse for particular characteristics. We hope more modellers will consider and test the assumptions of models used for parameter estimation and experiment with different model specifications resulting in higher quality microsimulation models and other research applications.

Title: Measuring Small Area Inequality Using Spatial Microsimulation: 
Lessons Learned from Australia
Abstract: Measuring income inequality has long been of interest in applied social and economic research in the OECD countries including Australia. This includes measuring income inequality at the regional level. In this article, we have used spatial microsimulation techniques to calculate small area inequality in Australia using disposable income data which are not available at Measuring Small Area Inequality Using Spatial Microsimulation: Lessons Learned from Australia a small area level, drawing together data from the Australian Census and survey data. Using disposable income data increases the strength of the results, as a more accurate measure of income distribution is able to be obtained. We estimate inequality at a small area level for the two most populous states in Australia New South Wales and Victoria using conventional Gini coefficient methodology. We also examine the differences in inequality between the densely populated capital cities of each state and the balance of these states or rural areas. The results show that there are marked variations in inequality with distinct pockets of small areas with high income inequality in both states and their capital cities. The small area inequality estimation enables the policy maker to pinpoint pockets of inequality. This will be useful to identify regions that need better targeting/interventions.

Abstract: The paper presents the main characteristics of BETAMOD, a static microsimulation model that reproduces the Italian personal income tax (IRPEF), as well as local income taxes, namely the regional and municipal surtaxes, building on a detailed reconstruction of tax legislation. With respect to the vast majority of existing tax microsimulation models, the peculiarities of BETAMOD concern two aspects: the inclusion of a detailed set of tax expenditures, and the estimation of individual-specific tax evasion rates, which account for the total individual income level, its composition in terms of income sources, and the geographical area of residence.

Abstract: Multi-agent microsimulation, as a third way of doing science other than induction and deduction methods, is explored to aid subway carriage design in this paper. Realizing that passenger behavior shapes the environment and in turn is shaped by the environment itself, we intend to model this interaction and examine the effectiveness and usability of the proposed model. We address our micro-model from essential aspects of environment space, agent attributes, agent behaviors, simulation process, and global objective/convergence function. Based on the real and simulated data, we evaluate our model with a combination of quantitative and qualitative procedures. For quantitative approach, we proposed two evaluation paradigms (i.e. unified multinomial classifier and one-vs.-all binary classifiers) using the state-of-the-art machine learning techniques and frameworks; and we manage to show from various perspectives that our model matches the reality in the majority of cases. For qualitative verification, we present a small-scale case study to evaluate different seat layouts in a subway carriage, and identify their advantages and disadvantages with little effort. By enriching microsimulation theory with innovative techniques, our research aims at promoting its acceptance level in design communities by means of avoiding costly creation of real-world experiments.

Abstract: The objective of this study was to develop a synthetic database which would be used with a microsimulation model to evaluate alternative health care financing options in Canada.  The Social Policy Simulation Database (SPSD), developed by Statistics Canada, was enhanced with population-based data on health status, disability, disease status, health service use and costs from the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) and other relevant data sources. The Social Policy Simulation Database and Model (SPSD/M) is a microsimulation tool designed to investigate the financial interactions between governments and individuals in Canada. Typically the SPSD/M has been used to inform policy around income tax, commodity tax, and cash transfer reform. We supplemented the models database with health data to enable analysis of alternative health care financing options in Canada. Data on health status, disability, disease status, health service, medication use and out-of-pocket spending on health care were drawn together from population-based surveys (including the CCHS, the Canadian Health Measures Survey (CHMS), Survey of Household Spending (SHS)), health administrative data (the Discharge Abstract Database (DAD)) and estimates of health service use and cost available in the literature. Costs of health services and drugs were assigned to individuals in the CCHS 2009/2010 (host health dataset) through imputation. The resulting health dataset was merged with the SPSD. Models using the enhanced SPSD -Health will allow health policy makers and academics to try-out alternative health care financing options, and consider their monetary impacts on individuals and families in Canada.

Abstract: The Finnish pension system consists of earnings-related pensions (almost 90% of the total pension expenditure) and the national pension. The earnings-related pension system will undergo a major reform in 2017. The main objective of the reform is to ease the burden on public finances by extending working lives. The earliest eligibility age for old-age pension will gradually rise from the current 63 years to 65 years by the 1962 birth cohort. After that, the earliest eligibility age will be linked to the growth in life expectancy. The age-specific accrual rates will be unified after a transition period. The early retirement schemes will also be reformed. The level of the disability benefits will improve. The forthcoming reform has been analysed using the ELSI microsimulation model of the Finnish Centre for Pensions. The model is based on administrative register data and it covers both the earnings-related and the national pension system of Finland. ELSI is a model with dynamic ageing without behavioural adjustments. The behavioural changes resulting from the reform have been taken into account explicitly: the age-gender-specific behaviour is obtained from our macro model using a micro-macro link. The differences in transition probabilities between educational groups are extrapolated from the register data.

Abstract: This paper analyzes the impacts of public investment in small-scale irrigation and farmer training on growth and agriculture-led development, on food security, and on poverty in Ethiopia. We use a dynamic Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model linked to a microsimulation model based on the latest household income and expenditure survey, in a topdown approach. All public investments are assumed to increase total factor productivity through increased supply of skilled labor and/or irrigated land. We find that investing in farmer training alone has great potential to increase growth, food security and poverty reduction, given that the economy is labor-intensive. Investing in training combined with irrigation has even greater impacts. An irrigation only approach will not yield the expected results if agricultural labor does not have the required skills. The irrigated agriculture sector has great potential despite its small size. However, for the impact to be notable, important investments are required in the first place to increase the share of irrigated agriculture versus the rain-fed. An agriculture-led development is less likely to occur because: i) of weak forward and backward production linkages between agriculture and manufacturing sectors; ii) a significant share of manufacturing inputs is imported; iii) the resulting contraction in private investment which restrains expansion of the manufacturing and services sectors

Abstract: In this paper we implement a sequential dynamic computable general equilibrium model combined with a microsimulation model to assess (1) the short- and long-run economic impacts of a gradual reduction in the export tax that was introduced during the economic crisis that hit Argentina at the end of 2001, and (2) the impact of a decrease in the world prices of food products, one of the countrys main export products. Our results show that the elimination of the export tax would have different long run effects depending on the fiscal instrument that is used by the government to compensate for the loss in tax revenue. On the one hand, when the government increased direct tax rate, there is a long-run positive effect on growth. In all cases, the employment level is lower and the price of food items is higher. Therefore, the poverty headcount ratio increases. As expected, a reduction in the world price of food items (i.e., a worsening in Argentinas terms of trade) would impact negatively on the countrys GDP growth rate and poverty, particularly in the rural areas.

Abstract: Despite experiencing high growth rates in recent decades, Burkina Faso remains a poor country. Poverty among children is particularly worrying, as it has long term (and often irreversible) effects on individuals. Furthermore, it can be transmitted from one generation to the next and significantly reduce economic growth. To address this issue requires fiscal and budgetary policies supporting health, education and improving the household economy. At the same time, the Burkina Fasos budget deficit has grown in recent years as a result of various crises, which have hit the country. This study uses a macro-micro model to evaluate three different policy interventions aimed at reducing child poverty in Burkina Faso under given budgetary constraints. The results indicate that increased public education spending helps raise school participation and promotion rates. This increases the supply and education level of skilled workers, leading to a reduced incidence and depth of both monetary and caloric poverty. A cash transfer scenario reduces child poverty even more.

Abstract: Persistent and very high-income inequality is a well-known feature of the Brazilian economy. However, from 2001 to 2014, the Gini index registered an unprecedented fall of 13.5% percent, combined with significant poverty reduction. Previous studies using partial equilibrium analysis have pointed out the important role of federal government transfer programs in this Bolsa Família (PBF) and Benefício de Prestação Continuada (BPC), in achieving their purpose of alleviating poverty and reducing inequality in Brazils income distribution. The simulation results, using an integrated modeling approach, confirm the importance of these programs in reducing inequality from 2003 to 2005. However, the effect on poverty alleviation was not strong. Finally, the methodological approach reveals some important mechanisms that were not present in previous analyses, such as the role of the tax structure that finances these policies.

Abstract: This study analyses the impact of trade liberalization on poverty in Ethiopia using a computable general equilibrium Microsimulation approach. Two scenarios (complete tariff cut and uniform tariff scheme) suggest that further liberalization of trade has a negative short-run effect on the overall economy. We find that the agriculture-based manufacturing sector (in particular, textile and leather) is likely to be strongly affected by tariff reductions. Poverty estimates show an increase in both scenarios. At the national level, complete tariff cut increases poverty by 2.8%, compared to 2.3% under a uniform tariff scheme. In both scenarios, poverty increases more among entrepreneur households (3.2% in the uniform tariff cut scenario), than farm and wage earner households (0.9% and 1.5%, respectively). This is consistent with the theoretical argument that previously-protected infant industries are highly affected by trade liberalization and may require compensatory policies.

Abstract: In 2007, a major tax reform was put into place in Uruguay with the explicit goals of promoting both greater efficiency and equity in the tax system. Overall, the reform substantially increased direct income taxes by establishing higher and rising marginal rates; lowered indirect taxation; reduced the corporate tax; harmonized employer contributions to social security across sectors and eliminated some highly distortionary taxes. We assess the joint effects of these changes on macroeconomic and labor outcomes, poverty and inequality using a top-down static CGE microsimulation approach. Overall we estimate a 1% increase in GDP and a 2% increase in employment due to the reform. We find substantial general equilibrium effects of the full implementation of the reform that tend to reinforce the reduction of poverty indicators, exclusively due to the modifications of the direct personal income tax without considering behavioral responses. Regarding poverty, the general equilibrium effects are significantly greater than the direct effects. Overall, we estimate a one-point reduction of the Gini coefficient due to the reform.

Title: Constructing Full Adult Life-cycles from Short Panels
Abstract: In this paper we discuss two alternative approaches to constructing complete adult life-cycles using data from an 18-year panel. The first of these is a splicing approach - closely related to imputation - that involves stitching together individuals observed at different ages. The second is a microsimulation approach that uses panel data to estimate transition probabilities between different states at adjacent ages and then simulates a large number of individuals with different initial values. Our aim throughout is to construct life-cycle profiles of employment, earnings and family circumstances that are representative of UK individuals born between 1945 and 1954. On balance, we find the microsimulation approach is to be preferred because it allows us to correct for observable differences across cohorts, and it is more amenable to counterfactual modelling.

Title: A Microsimulation Model for Risk in Irish Tillage Farming
Abstract: Tillage farmers must manage numerous economic risks including uncertain yields and prices. Despite the presence of government payments, these factors can generate a relatively high variability in farm income. The improved management of farm income variability can contribute towards stability in household consumption, support for farm investments, further investment in child education and a reduction in the mental stress associated with variable incomes. In this paper, we develop a new farm-level stochastic microsimulation model to simulate the degree of risk attached to the production of Irelands main tillage grain crop i.e. spring barley for animal feed usage. Forward contracting is the main available risk management tool for Irish tillage farmers. Our microsimulation model is extended in order to estimate the impact of forward contracting on farm income risk. Our results show that forward contracting can reduce farm income risk significantly but that other stable sources of income are probably necessary to contain the exposure to the income risk attached to cereal production. The model is capable of addressing the income risk associated with multiple crops although this version of the model is confined to one particular crop. The model can be further extended to accommodate other risk management tools such as crop insurance or a farm management deposit scheme. This will allow policymakers, farmers and other interested parties to assess the impact of alternative risk management policies on the heterogeneous pool of Irish tillage farmers.

Title: Improving the Validity of Microsimulation Results: Lessons from Slovakia 
Abstract: This paper summarizes the lessons learned in the process of building a microsimulation tool tailored to country-specific conditions and involving a maximum degree of user control. The objective to construct a model useful in the process of budgeting and fiscal forecasting has been achieved by paying attention to policy simulation details as well as to the representativeness of the underlying micro-dataset. The validity of simulated results improved significantly after the input database sample has been reweighted in such a way that the new weights replicate, among other factors, the earned income distribution and selected age cohorts directly. Innovative approaches in bringing the model closer to legislation as well as data highlight the benefits of having more user control compared with standardized microsimulation tools.

Title: Validation of Spatial Microsimulation Models: a Proposal to Adopt the Bland-Altman Method 
Abstract: Model validation is recognised as crucial to microsimulation modelling. However, modellers encounter difficulty in choosing the most meaningful methods to compare simulated and actual values. The aim of this paper is to introduce and demonstrate a method employed widely in healthcare calibration studies. The Bland-Altman plot consists of a plot of the difference between two methods against the mean (x-y versus x+y/2). A case study is presented to illustrate the method in practice for spatial microsimulation validation. The study features a deterministic combinatorial model (SimObesity), which modelled a synthetic population for England at the ward level using survey (ELSA) and Census 2011 data. Bland-Altman plots were generated, plotting simulated and census ward-level totals for each category of all constraint (benchmark) variables. Other validation metrics, such as R², SEI, TAE and RMSE, are also presented for comparison. The case study demonstrates how the Bland-Altman plots are interpreted. The simple visualisation
of both individual- (ward-) level difference and total variation gives the method an advantage over existing tools used in model validation. There still remains the question of what constitutes a valid or well-fitting model. However, the Bland Altman method can usefully be added to the canon of calibration methods.

Title:  Intertemporal Income in Ireland 1996-2011  A Spatial Analysis
Abstract: In this paper we employ a microsimulation approach to examine four census years (1996, 2002, 2006 & 2011). Using spatial microsimulation and GIS methods we create a spatially rich dataset for each year which is then used to create a spatial distribution of disposable income. The period covered in this paper is an important time in Irelands history and this paper takes a spatial perspective on the significant changes in the landscape of disposable income. By adopting this approach we can examine if there are clear disparities between different areas of the country. From our results we have showed that there are significant differences in how regions have performed during this period 1996-2011. The major urban centres and hubs have outperformed the rural areas in terms of levels of disposable income. Even amongst urban areas, Dublin has outperformed all other areas becoming an outlier such is the difference in levels of disposable income. The Celtic Tiger, Property Bubble and Great Recession have all impacted on the different  regions in different ways.

Title:  Estimating and Simulating with a Random Utility Random Opportunity Model of Job Choice Presentation and Application to Belgium
Abstract: We present the Random Utility Random Opportunity (ruro) model of job choice (Aaberge, Dagsvik and Strøm, 1995, and Aaberge, Colombino and Strøm, 1999) and report estimation results from an application of a version of that model on Belgian data (eusilc 2007). We discuss the effect of education level on the intensity of preference for leisure relative to consumption, on the intensity of job offers, and on the wage offer distribution. Finally, we report simulation results with respect to the impact on labour market participation by letting the male catch up the arrears in educational attainment they currently have with respect to females

Title: Evaluating The Quality Of Gross Incomes In SILC: Compare Them With Fiscal Data And Re-calibrate Them Using EUROMOD
Abstract: In this paper, we shed light on the quality of the gross incomes as reported in the Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC). This is done in three steps. First, as both net and gross incomes are reported in SILC, implicit tax rates are calculated and evaluated. In a second step, gross incomes from SILC are compared with gross incomes reported on the fiscal form for the same individuals. Finally, we make use of EUROMOD to re-calibrate SILC gross incomes in order to make them consistent with the reported net ones. We find that, on average, fiscally reported gross incomes exceed gross incomes in the SILC survey. It is not clear however whether the re-calibration method (whereby we use an iterative method to construct adjusted SILC gross incomes starting from the observed net ones) is a genuine improvement upon the reported gross income distribution.

Title: The Eurosystem Household Finance and Consumption Survey: A New Underlying Database for EUROMOD
Abstract: We explore the prospects for using the Eurosystem Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS) dataset as an underlying micro-database for the EU tax-benefit model, EUROMOD. This will allow expanding the policy domains currently covered in EUROMOD with dimensions like wealth taxation, incentives for wealth accumulation and asset tests determining benefit eligibility. As the HFCS only contains gross income amounts which are not suitable for distributive analysis, the purpose of this paper is to derive net incomes by simulating the gross-to-net transition with EUROMOD taking into account all important details of the social security and personal income tax system. In order to identify the issues and illustrate their importance a trial database for Belgium and Italy is constructed

Title: Constructing a Synthetic City for Estimating Spatially Disaggregated Heat Demand
Abstract:  We present a procedure for creating a spatially referenced building stock with population living therein ?a synthetic city? for the case of Germany. The level of spatial disaggregation is the European NUTS?3 level for which data from the newest census (2011) exist. Our application is on the estimation of heat demand. We use the German microcensus (2010) which contains both: (a) detailed sociodemographic characteristics of individuals and (b) detailed information on the type of buildings in which these individuals live. With this data we can generate not only a synthetic population but also a synthetic building stock. The microcensus records the construction year and number of dwelling units of buildings. This allow us to classify the buildings for the estimation of heat demand. This procedure has two major advantages: (1) there exist many models for the estimation of heat demand at building level, we can make use of these models, and (2) with the microcensus as the only required data source we are able to estimate heat demand at a spatially disaggregated level for the entire country. We conclude our paper with an internal validation of the microsimulation model by means of the Total Absolute Error T AE and present the first results from this model aggregated at the NUTS?3 level for the entire country. We briefly discuss the observed patters of the results and attempt to hypothesize on the reasons behind this patterns. We also discuss the difficulties of an external validation of this model and how we can address them in the future.

Title: Logit Scaling: A General Method for Alignment in Microsimulation models
Abstract: A general and easily implemented method for alignment in microsimulation models is proposed. Most existing alignment methods address the binary case and they typically put special emphasis on one of the alternatives rather than treating all alternatives in a symmetric way. In this paper we propose a general mathematical foundation of multinominal alignment, which minimizes the relative entropy in the process of aligning probabilities to given targets. The method is called Logit Scaling. The analytical solution to the alignment problem is characterized and applied in deriving various properties for the method. It is demonstrated that there exits an algorithm called Bi-Proportional Scaling that converges to the solution of the problem. This is tested against two versions of the Newton-Raphson-algoritm, and it is demonstrated that it is at least twice as fast as these methods. Finally, the method is not just computational efficient but also easy to implement.

Title:  NCDMod: A Microsimulation Model Projecting Chronic Disease and Risk Factors for Australian Adults 
Abstract: Chronic disease and the associated risk factors are an ongoing public health concern. They represent a major burden of disease and result in significant health expenditure. The purpose of this paper is to describe the development and attributes of the microsimulation model NCDMod, an Australian, purpose-built model that simulates multiple chronic diseases and associated risk factors. The model offers flexibility in perspective and population of interest. The model projects out to 2025 in 5-year increments using a combination of static and dynamic methods. Transition equations are sourced from the literature and in-house analysis. NCDMod is able to capture the impacts of population ageing and shifts in incidence of specific chronic diseases and risk factors. Results from NCDMod will help to fill gaps in current Australian evidence on the population level impacts of interventions to prevent/delay chronic health conditions particularly diabetes, heart disease and obesity. Further, in combination with HealthWealthMod2030 this model will be able to offer evidence regarding the potential impact of health interventions on the long-term costs (both from an individual and government

Title: Building a Microsimulation Model of Heroin Use Careers in Australia 
Abstract: Illicit heroin use is a worldwide problem, with significant health and social costs. Treatment is known to be effective in changing heroin use habits, but it often needs to be provided over a lifetime, with people cycling in and out of treatment. It is therefore important to capture a long-term perspective on heroin use careers. The aim of this project was to build a lifetime microsimulation model of heroin using careers. This paper describes the conceptual
logic of the model, the input parameters and the verification and validation results. A microsimulation model was chosen as the most appropriate simulation platform with 9 states, and 111,400 individuals (aged between 18 and 60) each with gender, HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) and HCV (hepatitis C) status, and treatment history. Probabilities associated with crime commission and individually calculated lengths of stay in each state were determined from multiple datasets. The model included costs associated with treatment provision, healthcare services, criminal activity, life years lost, and family benefit of treatment. The final model represented 42 years of a heroin use career for a cohort based on Australian (New South Wales) data. Individuals cycle into and out of heroin using states (including abstinence), as well as treatment and prison states. We were able to build a stable, tractable model and verified all parameters. Validation against external data sources revealed high validity. While there are limitations associated with any model, the heroin career model now has the potential to be used for simulations of alternate policy scenarios.

Title: Microreg: A Traditional Tax-Benefit Microsimulation Model Extended To Indirect Taxes And In Kind Transfers
Abstract: MicroReg is a tax-benefit microsimulation model, developed by IRPET (Regional Institute for Economic Planning in Tuscany), able to simulate the main fiscal policies for all the Italian  Regions.  The  model  is  based  on  the  EUROSTAT  Survey  on  Income  and  Living Conditions (EU-SILC). In its traditional version MicroReg can simulate direct taxes and in-cash transfers,  but  recently  it  was  extended  in  two  directions.  The  first  extension  aims  at  adding indirect taxes to simulated tax policies, thanks to a statistical matching between EU-SILC and the Italian Household Budget Survey by Istat(National Institute of Statistics (Italy)). To improve the matching, an estimation of the level of expenditure for each EU-SILC household is added to the variables  on  which  the  matching  is  conditioned,  by  applying  the  relation  between  consumption and  income  estimated  on  the  Bank  of  Italy  Survey  of  Households  Income  and  Wealth.  The second  extension  aims  at including in-kind  transfers,  in  health  and  education and in  household disposable income. The  monetary value of in-kind transfers is estimated with the public cost of production by using national and regional administrative data. The allocation of benefits among individuals  is  done  by  following  the  so  called  "actual  consumption  approach",  both  for  health and education. This paper describes MicroReg, focusing on the new extensions, and the results of an application to assess the distributive effects of fiscal policies introduced in the last few years in Italy, both on the revenue and on the expenditure side.

Title: Regressivity-Reducing VAT Reforms
Abstract: A concern about a more extensive use of the Value Added Tax (VAT) in national tax systems often arises both from its impact on aggregate consumption and its alleged regressivity over income. Yet, the empirical evidence on this latter issue is still narrow mainly due to the lack of joint data on income and expenditures with enough detail to account for commodity-specific tax rates. After discussing relevant problems in the measurement of VAT incidence over current income - which are likely to cause severe upward bias in the estimated regressivity - the paper aims at analysing the distributional implications of different VAT structures. In a framework of marginal tax reforms, relying on the concept of Gini elasticity (Yitzhaki, 1983), a general methodology is proposed to analyse and improve the distributional profile of VAT over income. Using a static microsimulationmodel(EGaLiTe),the methodology is applied on a comprehensive dataset of expenditures and incomes obtained by a statistical matching of two different sources representative of the Italian population. It is shown that an alternative allocation of goods among existing rates could mitigate the regressive profile of the tax over income, and that a properly designed two-rate setting could even improve the distributional outcome compared with the current setting. Finally, behavioural responses to tax-driven price changes are also simulated in order to assess the potential impact of the proposed reforms on aggregate expenditures.

Title: Inequality and Household Size: A Microsimulation for Uruguay
Abstract: Declines  in fertility  and  consequently  in  household  size  are  among  the  main demographic changes that took place in many Latin American countries during the last decades. This demographic alteration may have had an impact on income distribution in case the patterns of decline were not similar between rich and poor households. In order to understand the driving forces  of  inequality  changes  in  Uruguay,  we  consider  the  role  of  differential  changes  in reproductive behaviour and household formation on inequality and also on poverty, for two time periods  (1996-2007  and  2007-2013).  We  estimate  the  effects  of  changes  in  the  number  of children  in  the  household  on  mean  income  and  specially,  on  the  distribution  of  income  and  on poverty.  Based  on  microsimulation  techniques,  our  results  indicate  that  both  poverty  and inequality  would  have  been  lower  if  changes  in  household  size  had  not  taken  place  among Uruguayan households. This ultimately implies that changes in fertility have contributed to higher levels of poverty and inequality, although the size of the total effect is not large. These results are mainly  driven  by  a  direct  channel  dominated  by  the  evolution  of  the  parameters  that  govern decisions about number of children in the household. Indirect effects, through the labour market, operated in a countervailing manner but due to their smaller magnitude, they were offset by the direct effect.

Title: JAS-mine: A new platform for microsimulation and agent-based modelling
Abstract: We introduce JAS-mine, a new Java-based computational platform that features tools to support the development of large-scale, data-driven, discrete-event simulations. JAS-mine is specifically designed for both agent-based and microsimulation modelling, anticipating a convergence between the two approaches. An embedded relational database management system provides tools for sophisticated input-output communications and data storage, allowing the power of relational databases to be used within an object-oriented framework. The JAS-mine philosophy encourages the separation of distinct concepts, objects and functionalities of the simulation model, and advocates and supports transparency, flexibility and modularity in model design. For instance, JAS-mine allows to store the list of regressors and their estimated coefficients externally to code, making it easy to change the specification of regression models used in the simulation and achieving a complete parallelisation between the tasks of the econometricians and those of the programmers. Moreover, tools for uncertainty analysis and search over the parameter space are also built in.

Title: Parameterising a detailed dynamic programming model of savings and labour supply using cross-sectional data
Abstract: Dynamic programming methods are now commonly used to describe behaviour in contexts where uncertainty is likely to have an important bearing on decision making. Using a publicly available structural dynamic microsimulation model, LINDA, this paper provides new insights into how unobservable preference parameters ? particularly those associated with risk aversion ? can be coherently identified on broad-based moments of decision making observed for a population cross-section. Preference parameters identified on UK data are found to be in-line with those reported in the wider econometric literature

Title: A Fine Grained Hybrid Spatial Microsimulation Technique for Generating Detailed Synthetic Individuals from Multiple Data Sources: An Application To Walking And Cycling
Abstract: We  propose  a  hybrid  static  spatial  microsimulation  technique that combines simulated annealing and synthetic reconstruction (Monte-Carlo sampling), in order to generate a synthetic  population of  individuals  as  part  of  a  model-based  policy  indicator.  We  focus  on  the following case: (i) the model must produce outputs at a fine spatial resolution; (ii) the individuals have  many  attributes the majority  of  which are  found  in  an available micro-data survey,  though some attributes are missing and need to be added from other sources. The hybrid method proposed uses simulated annealing to simulate the majority of the required attributes, and Monte-Carlo sampling to add the missing attributes. Our paper expands the range of techniques which could produce this type of model. We test the hybrid technique on a UK example estimating the capability of individuals to make journeys by walking and cycling, in order to produce a novel indicator of resilience  to  the  disruption  of  fuel  availability. Additionally,  the  staged approach  means  that  the intermediate  steps  in  the  spatial  microsimulation  modelling  process  generate  data  on  bicycle availability and the need to escort children during commuting that are useful in their own right.

Title: A Microsimulation Model of Fertility, Childbearing, and Child Well-Being
Abstract: The topic of family structure features prominently in social policy debates in the United States. This paper details the architecture of FamilyScape 3.0, a microsimulation tool that models a wide variety of real-world behaviours and outcomes related to family formation and child well-being. We describe FamilyScape?s procedures for simulating sexual activity, contraceptive behaviour, female fecundity, contraceptive efficacy, pregnancy and pregnancy outcomes, and maternal and child outcomes. We present an extensive set of simulation results demonstrating that the model realistically simulates of each of these dynamics. Most importantly, we show that FamilyScape closely approximates real-world rates of contraceptive failure, pregnancy, childbearing, and abortion. We conclude by briefly discussing the model?s potential to inform a range of policy debates

Title: Coordination in Centralized and Decentralized Systems
Abstract: We study a simple coordination problem to understand the difference between centralized and decentralized economic systems. The decentralized system is more robust than the centralized system to communication errors. But the centralized system takes less time than the decentralized system to create coordination among constituent parts. Decentralization is preferable when the constituent parts are more likely to make communication errors, when there is little urgency, and when there is need to prevent system-collapse.

Title: Microsimulations of Demographic Changes in England and Wales Under Different EU Referendum Scenarios
Abstract: We perform stochastic microsimulations of the dynamics of England and Wales population after the British referendum on EU membership, considering different possible outcomes. Employing available survey data, we model the demographics of the region over the next generation, as shaped by births, deaths and international migration. The migration patterns between England and Wales and the remaining EU countries are modified according to the possible scenarios of their future relations. We find that Brexit will accelerate the overall population ageing and the deepening imbalance between workers and retirees but reduce the population growth and the fraction of women of reproductive age. In the alternative scenarios of remaining in the EU these effects will be partially forestalled by waves of immigration from current and prospective EU countries and their children. In all considered scenarios the native British population declines. Our study demonstrates that microsimulations can be a useful tool for designing and evaluating the country?s policies in the advent of fundamental transformations.

Title: simSALUD: Design and Implementation of an Open-source Wizard based Spatial Microsimulation Framework
Abstract: Spatial microsimulation models have been in use for around 40 years for various applications. Responding to users? needs and project purpose, many have emerged using different methods and algorithms. Despite this, the literature suggests a gap in applications combining operability, flexibility, availability or generally an implementation of an online web mapping application in the area of spatial microsimulation. In this paper we introduce the development of a new open-source web-based spatial microsimulation framework, called simSALUD, as a solution approach for static simulation modelling where no programming skills are required. The emphasis lies on the design and implementation of the wizard and web-based spatial microsimulation application, including integrated validation and mapping elements. The current version supports two deterministic spatial microsimulation algorithms (combinatorial optimisation and iterative proportional fitting). The application is designed for experts as well as for non-experts to simulate their own spatial microdata. In addition, the application integrates statistical tools to validate and verify the robustness of the models ad hoc. The outputs of the simulation and validation results can either be visualized in the form of a map within the application or exported as comma separated files for further analyses. simSALUD comes with a demonstration dataset, an extensive documentation and video tutorial to disburden the usage of the software. The architecture of simSALUD was designed with the possibility to expand the tool towards a spatial decision support system, allowing measurement of possible future policy interventions on population groups at small geographies.

Title:  A Tax-Benefit Model for Austria (AUTAX): Work Incentives and Distributional Effects of the 2016 Tax Reform
Abstract: This study introduces a tax-benefit model based on administrative data for Austria (AUTAX) that can be used for theex ante and ex post evaluation of reforms of personal income taxation and social benefits. We analyze the effects of the 2016 Austrian tax reform ex anteand concentrate on the effects on the distribution of net income and on work incentives. Our results show that the changes to the tax brackets have slightly increased inequality, and the middle- and high-income earners profited most. This effect has been significantly lowered by an increase in the negative income tax for low-income earners. By calculating average effective tax rates (AETRs) as well as marginal effective tax rates (METRs) along the whole income distribution in our model, we discuss changes on work incentives on the extensive but also on the intensive margin. We show that the 2016 tax reform positively affected the work incentives on the extensive and the intensive margin for higher income groups. The additional change in the negative income tax had only an impact on the extensive margin of low-income earners. These low-income earners are usually part-time workers, therefore giving a higher incentive to work part-time but no additional incentive to increase working hours. We show that a decrease in social security contributions instead of an increase in the negative income tax for low-income earners would lead to an increase in both the extensive and the intensive margin.

Title: Life Time Pension Benefits Relative to Life Time Contributions
Abstract: By extending a dynamic micro simulation model we compare total expected discounted contributions to the Norwegian National Insurance System with expected discounted sum of benefits from pensions received for cohorts born between 1910 and 2070. The results show that the cohorts, who established the pay-as-you-go system in 1967, experienced a substantial gain by letting future generations pay. As a result of the pension reform from 2011 future pension benefits will be tightened. With a positive net rate of interest cohorts born between 1950 and 1980 are those who are most hurt by the reform, while cohorts born after 2000 gain.

Title:  MILC: A Microsimulation Model of the Natural History of Lung Cancer
Abstract: The Microsimulation Lung Cancer (MILC) model was developed to simulate individual trajectories and predict outcomes of lung cancer for populations. The model describes the natural history of lung cancer from a disease-free state to death. Predictions of individual trajectories depend on a set of covariates including age, sex, and smoking behaviors. The module presented here is designed as part of a comprehensive decision-making toolkit for evaluating lung cancer prevention, screening and treatment policies. The MILC package implements the model in the open-source statistical software R. This paper introduces the main components, simulation algorithm, and specifics of the MILC model, validates it by reproducing observed lung cancer incidence trends in the US population, and uses it to make plausible predictions for 50-year-old men and women with a range of smoking histories.

Title:  Solving a Partial Equilibrium Model in a CGE Framework: The Case of a Behavioural Microsimulation Model
Abstract: This paper presents a simple approach to wrapping a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model around a behavioural microsimulation (BMS) model. The approach is akin to decomposing an integrated CGE model into a partial equilibrium (PE) or a BMS model and a ?residual? CGE model. This is likely to improve the BMS analysis when changes in labour supply are projected to be large. Specifically, this paper outlines how a household module with many households can be separated from the CGE model and how the resulting PE sub-model and CGE model can be solved iteratively, so that the equilibrium is identical to that obtained with an equivalent fully integrated model. The paper focuses on two challenges that arise when linking and solving the two models: how to find a convergent solution and how to ensure that it is a true general equilibrium solution. This involves ensuring that databases and theory in both models are consistent and fit exactly with each other. Some cases may require the use of a temporary slack variable to facilitate convergence. The approach has the potential to extend the range and quality of the analysis of policy-relevant issues.

Title:  Spatial Competition with Interacting Agents
Abstract: Using agent-based modeling, we generalize Hotelling?s model of spatial competition with more than two firms in a two-dimensional space. Firms choose both price and location to maximize profits. The principle of minimum differentiation does not hold in general. Local duopolies emerge from the interaction betweenfirms. Firms do not spread uniformly across the two-dimensional space, nor do they all charge the same price. Firms in more competitive locations charge lower prices and generate less profit.

Title:  Projected Population, Inequality and Social Expenditures: The Case of Flanders
Abstract: We investigate the budgetary and distributional effects of a demographic and economic evolution in Flanders between 2011 and 2031. We project demographic changes by means of two multi-state population projections (LiPro-projections), on the basis of which we statically reweigh the EU-SILC 2008 dataset. In addition, we assume a modest real exogenous ?meaning not induced by the demographic projections? growth rate of 1%. Population-wise, we find a pronounced ageing, a growth of single-headed households, mostly to the detriment of couples with children, and a closing generational gap in education. While income inequality exhibits a non-monotonous pattern over time (reaching a maximum around 2020), poverty steadily declines after 2011. We find a large increase in expenditures on pensions, which is, however, covered by the modest public income growth we assume, while keeping the tax system constant in real terms.

Title:  Exploring the Importance of Incentive Responses for Policy Projections
Abstract: Behavioural responses to incentives is appealing functionality for any analytical tool designed to explore the implications of public policy alternatives. This study explores the interdependence between projected savings and labour supply decisions implied by a detailed and empirically validated microsimulation model of UK households. Analysis focusses upon sensitivity of projected effects of two generic policy counterfactuals, to three alternative approaches for projecting savings and employment decisions. The results reveal that a well-specified reduced-form can generate qualitatively similar projections for policy counterfactuals to a structural approach, even if quantitative differences are difficult to avoid. Furthermore, adapting a reducedform model to accommodate structural employment responses can be expected to obtain a close quantitative approximation to short-run projections in which both employment and savings decisions are based on utility maximisation theory. The same is not true, however, for longer-run projections due to the cumulative influence of state-specific variation.

Title:  The Code is the Model
Abstract: Conventionally, agent-based models are specified in a combination of natural language and mathematical terms, and their implementation seen as an afterthought. I challenge this view and argue that it is the source code that represents the model best, with natural language and mathematical descriptions serving as documentation. This modeling paradigm is inspired by agile software development and adopting it leads to various - mostly beneficial - consequences. First, discrepancies between the specification documents and what the model actually does are eliminated by definition as the code becomes the specification. Second, replicability is greatly improved. Third, object-oriented programming is recognized as an integral part of a modeler?s skill set. Forth, tools and methods from software engineering can support the modeling process, making it more agile. Fifth, increased modularity allows to better manage complexity and enables the collaborative construction of large models. Sixth, the way models are published needs to be reconsidered, with source code ideally being part of the peer review. Seventh, the quality of source code in science is improved as it enjoys more importance, attention and scrutiny.

Title:  Why Complex, Data Demanding and Difficult to Estimate Agent Based Models? Lessons from a Decades Long Research Program
Abstract: Questions are often raised about the economy-wide long-term consequences of micro (policy) interventions in an economy. To answer such questions, complex high dimensional, agent-based and difficult to estimate models are needed. This soon takes the economist outside the range of mathematics s/he is comfortable with. Such was, however, the ambition of the Swedish micro firm to macroeconomic systems modelling project presented in this essay, initiated almost 45 years ago. This model is presented as a Reference model for theoretical and empirical studies, with the ambition to understand the roles of the “birth, life and death” of business agents in the volution of a self-coordinated market economy, without the help of a Walrasian central planner. Mathematical simulation is argued to be the effective tool for such theoretical and empirical analyses. Four problems have been chosen that demand a model of the Reference type to address, and that the Reference model has been used to address. They are (1) exploring the interior structures of the model for surprise analytical outcomes not previously observed, or thought of; (2) quantifying the long-term costs and benefits of large structure changing micro-interventions in the economy; (3) studying long-term historical economic systems evolutions, and asking what could have happened alternatively, if the historic evolution would have originated differently, and (4) generalizing from case observations.

Title:  Increasing the Impact of Dynamic Microsimulation Modelling 
Abstract: This paper considers the degree of progress made by the field of dynamic microsimulation over the past five decades. It highlights the expanding breadth of the field, both in terms of the number of countries and in terms of the broadening policy area. It also outlines concerns in relation to lack of emphasis historically in relation to the transmission of codified and in the sometimes proprietary ownership model. Moving forward, an improved focus on the codification and peer review of methodologies used in the field is suggested. In terms of tacit knowledge transmission, the organisation of more regional meetings of the International Microsimulation Association is encouraged. In terms of future areas for model development, the opportunities are to incorporate behaviour to a greater extent, utilise more data in the big data revolution, to increase the field of microsimulation into new policy areas, and to share code and work in networks. Finally, the role of peer review is highlighted.

Title:  A Brief, Global History of Microsimulation Models in Health: Past Applications, Lessons Learned and Future Directions
Abstract: This review discusses the evolution of microsimulation models in health over the past three decades. We focus on three aspects of health microsimulation. First, we describe the origins and applications of health microsimulation, including how early research challenged early methodologies and led to the development of more rigorous models. We describe limitations of early means-based models and how more detailed methods, which are based on health-specific input data, overcame many of the early data shortfalls and assumptions. Second, we discuss the global expansion of applications of microsimulation to health over the last ten years. Many health microsimulation models have focussed on health expenditure, the ageing population, diabetes, mortality modelling, and spatial models. Health models over the past few decades have expanded to many countries including Canada, Africa, the United States, the UK, Sweden, the Netherlands, New Zealand and Australia. Finally, we describe future developments, including emerging research fields for microsimulation and health and how the early development of health microsimulation models provides important lessons for emerging applications. These include the emerging field of genomics and precision medicine, and the diagnosis and treatment of childhood cancers and rare diseases. We suggest research directions, including the need for good data to avoid model errors, and highlight some pitfalls to avoid.

Title:  Structural Labour Supply Models and Microsimulation
Abstract: The purpose of the paper is to provide a discussion of the various approaches for accounting for labour supply responses in microsimulation models. The paper focus attention on two methodologies for modelling labour supply: (i) the discrete choice model and (ii) the random utility – random opportunities model. The paper then describes approaches to utilising these models for policy simulation in terms of producing and interpreting simulation outcomes, outlining an extensive literature of policy analyses utilising these approaches. Labour supply models are not only central for analysing behavioural labour supply responses but also for identifying optimal tax-benefit systems, given some of the challenges of the theoretical approach. Combining labour supply results with individual and social welfare functions enables the social evaluation of policy simulations. Combining welfare functions and labour supply functions, the paper discusses how to model socially optimal income taxation

Title:  Quality Assessment of Microsimulation Models The Case of EUROMOD
Abstract: Assessing the quality of microsimulation models is an important contributing factor for motivating their use in both academic and policy environments. This is particularly relevant for EUROMOD, the tax-benefit microsimulation model for the European Union, because it is intended to be widely used. This paper explains how the quality of EUROMOD is assessed. It focusses on the validity and scope of results as particularly important dimensions of quality, and on the transparency with which this assessment is done. It also provides evidence on the extent and breadth of the use of EUROMOD. Some of the key trade-offs between different aspects of quality are identified and the paper concludes with a view on the appropriate division of responsibility for quality assessment, between model developers and users.

Title: Female Labour Force Projections Using Microsimulation for Six EU Countries 
Abstract: We project medium to long term trends in labour force participation and employment for selected low-participation European Union countries (Italy, Spain, Ireland, Hungary and Greece), with Sweden as a benchmark, by means of a dynamic microsimulation model. By 2020, only Sweden will be above the Europe 2020 target of 75% employment rate, though Ireland will be close; the target will be approached by all other countries only at the end of the simulation period at 2050, with the exception of Hungary. Our forecasts, that fully take into account the uncertainty coming from the estimation of all the processes in the significantly depart from the official projections of the European Commission for two of the six countries under analysis. microsimulation,

Title:  The Impact of the Retirement Decision and Demographics on Pension Sustainability: A Dynamic Microsimulation Analysis
Abstract: This paper investigates how retirement decisions, in interaction with demographic changes, impact on pension system sustainability. To do so, we introduce behaviour into a dynamic microsimulation model applied to the Spanish case. Specifically, the retirement decision is modelled using a reduced-form survival model that provides information on retirement hazards, which are then used to calculate times to retirement within the microsimulation model. This model allows us to account for behavioural responses. For example, the behavioural reaction to the 2011 reform improves pension system sustainability, despite individuals opting to retire later to obtain higher benefits. The positive effect (increase in contributions and reduction in time spent in retirement) is greater than the negative effect (increase in pension levels). Additionally, the model allows us to show how the positive effects of the education transition and higher rates of female and older worker participation contribute to reducing the negative impact of population ageing.

Title:  A New Heuristic in Mutual Sequential Mate Search
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new heuristic to be used as a mate search strategy in the human mate choice model of Todd and Miller (1999). This heuristic, which we call Take the Weighted Average with the Next Desiring Date, is a plausible search rule in terms of informational assumptions. Our simulations show that this new heuristic is in terms of mating likelihood almost as good as, and in terms of mating speed always better than, the most successful —yet also unrealistic— heuristic of Todd and Miller (1999), namely the Mate Value-5 rule, which assumes that individuals in the mating population completely know their own mate values before interacting with any date. The success of our heuristic stems from its extreme power to lead an average individual in the mating population to always underestimate his/her own mate value during the adolescence (learning) phase of the mating process. While our new heuristic is also found to be successfully egalitarian in pairing up individuals, it does not perform well in terms of marital stability

Title:  Distributional Impacts of Behavioral Effects – Ex-Ante Evaluation of the 2017 Unemployment Insurance Reform in Finland
Abstract: In 2017, the potential duration of the Finnish earnings-related unemployment benefit was cut from 500 to 400 days (or 400 to 300 working days). We apply a microsimulation method to calculate both static and behavioral ex-ante effects of the reform on employment, public finances and income inequality. Relying on previous empirical literature, we employ three benefit elasticity levels. Individual heterogeneity is added by weighting the elasticities with estimated employment probabilities. According to the static scenario, the reform increases income inequality, albeit marginally. Accounting for the behavioral response mitigates the effect on inequality and more than doubles the effect on public finances.

Title:  Simulating the Joint Distribution of Individuals, Households and Dwellings in Small Areas
Abstract: : This article proposes a sample-based methodology for synthesizing individuals, households and dwellings in small areas, illustrated using a case study of Amsterdam. The method encompasses the following steps: first, individual- and household-level tables are created separately using Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF). Second, synthetic individuals are allocated into synthetic households using a combination of sorting algorithms and mixed integer programming. As such, the synthetic households are adjusted to accommodate the synthetic individuals, ensuring a consistent joint distribution of individuals, households and dwellings in small areas.

Title:  A Top-Down with Behaviour (TDB) Microsimulation Toolkit for Distributive Analysis
Abstract: Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) models are often combined with microsimulation (MS) models to perform distributive impact analysis for fiscal or structural policies, or external shocks. This paper describes a user-friendly Stata-based toolkit to perform MSs combined with CGE models in a top-down fashion. The toolkit is organized in various modules, which can be easily adapted to the users’ needs. It first estimates income generation by type of work and skill of workers. Then it estimates households’ specific price deflators based on individual utility. The changes estimated by a CGE model (or from other sources) in the employment (by skill and sector), in the wage payroll (by skill), in the revenues from self-employment activities (by skill) as well as in the commodities prices are fed into the MS model in a consistent way. Once the new vector of real consumption or revenue is estimated, it performs a series of distributive analysis, such as the computation of standard poverty and inequality indices, their decomposition by income

Title:  The Distributional Impact of VAT Reduction for Food in Hungary: Results from a Hungarian Microsimulation Model
Abstract: In this paper we illustrate how the incorporation of behavioural responses and dynamic effects alters the conclusions of static household microsimulation models on the distributional impacts of economic policies. Based on Hungary’s Household Budget and Living Conditions Survey, we model household consumption using the demand system approach of Creedy, 1998. This method makes it possible to obtain reasonable price elasticity estimates of consumption from cross-sectional data by combining them with Frisch-parameter values obtained from cross-country studies. With this consumption module, we simulate the distributional impacts of a hypothetical food VAT rate change in Hungary and show how the static and behavioural impact estimates differ according to income decile. We examine the sensitivity of our results to the choice of the country-level Frisch-parameter and to a realistic allowance for household-level variation in the Frisch-parameter.

Title: The Evaluation of Fiscal Consolidation Strategies 
Abstract: : In this paper, we present a framework and perform an assessment of different fiscal consolidation strategies both on the revenue as well as on the expenditure sides of the budget in the context of Slovakia. The model we use for simulations is a behavioural general-equilibrium what-if model. We analyse the simulated impacts of consolidation strategies on growth and on fiscal balance (both in short- and long- term). The microsimulation approach allows us also to evaluate the distributional impacts. In addition, the approach permits to compare the statutory with the resulting tax incidence in the long-run. We simulate strategies based on taxing labour income, taxing consumption as well as cutting expenditures on social transfers. We document that corporate and labour taxes are more unfavourable to output growth, while consumption taxes belong to less damaging instruments for consolidation. We show that spending cuts may promote employment and are not detrimental to output growth.

Title: Care&WorkMOD: An Australian Microsimulation Model Projecting the Economic Impacts of Early Retirement in Informal Carers
Abstract: We developed a microsimulation model, Care&WorkMOD, to estimate the economic costs of early exit from the labour force, both for informal carers and the government, from 2015 to 2030. In this paper, we describe the methods used to create the model Care&WorkMOD, and the sources of data and model assumptions. Care&WorkMOD is based on the unit record data of people aged 15-64 years in the three Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Surveys of Disability, Ageing and Carers (SDAC) 2003, 2009 and 2012. Population and the labour force projections from the 2015 Intergenerational Report and the outputs of an Australian microsimulation model APPSIM were used for the static aging of the base data to every five years from 2015 to 2030. The 2015 output dataset of another microsimulation model STINMOD was linked with Care&WorkMOD base data using synthetic matching. The matching process has added data on further economic variables from STINMOD into Care&WorkMOD, which are not available in SDACs. Economic data were indexed based on long-term trends on economic variables to capture the projected economic growth from 2015 to 2030. Care&WorkMOD can provide the long-term estimates of the lost labour productivity due to informal caring responsibilities and the related economic burden both at the individual and national level, and has the potential to “fill the gaps” in the current body of evidence on the costs of chronic diseases, particularly related to informal carers

Title: Global Sensitivity Analysis of a Model Simulating an Individual’s Health State through Their Lifetime
Abstract: In public health, model predictions are used by decision-makers to minimise health burdens and monetary costs of non-communicable diseases. Fully understanding the uncertainty underlying those predictions is thus crucial. One-parameter-at-a-time methods are typically used for model uncertainty analysis but are often impractical for large-scale nonlinear models containing a very large number of parameters and cannot be used to examine the uncertainty associated with parameter interaction. An individual-based chronic disease model was developed to model the impact of Body Mass Index (BMI) trends on the rates of non-communicable diseases. The model was simulated for overweight and obese male case studies and used to predict their life expectancy, disease-free life expectancy and quality-adjusted life years. Uncertainty was estimated by carrying out a global sensitivity analysis by assessing the contribution to the overall uncertainty from a selection of parameters individually and from their interactions. Results show that the uncertainty of the BMI input parameter had the greatest impact on the disease-free life expectancy and quality adjusted life year uncertainty compared to the relative risks of colorectal cancer and stroke. Life expectancy uncertainty was influenced by BMI and colorectal cancer relative risks. Global sensitivity analysis enables the assessment of the parametric uncertainty for individual parameters and their interaction. This allows the communication of the uncertainty of different policy options. A strategy for scaling-up uncertainty analysis from an individual to a population level is discussed.

Title: Microsimulation of Child Benefits: A Review of Studies
Abstract: : This paper reviews studies that use static non-behavioural microsimulation models of taxes and benefits in the analysis of child benefits. The studies are categorised into four groups according to the main topic of enquiry: the estimation of benefit incidence, the analysis of actual reforms, the importation of policies from other countries and freestyle reforms. The methods for measuring social welfare used in these studies are summarised. Additionally, a brief overview of the research using static behavioural, dynamic, and spatial models is provided. The paper discusses the main findings and recommends directions for further research

Title: A Role for Universal Pension? Simulating Universal Pensions in Ecuador, Ghana, Tanzania and South Africa  
Abstract: We use four novel, cross-country comparable tax-benefit microsimulation models for Ecuador, Ghana, Tanzania and South Africa to analyse ex ante the expansion of a universal old-age pension in a static setting. Universal pensions would significantly reduce poverty and inequality in settings where no means-tested old-age pensions exist (such as in Ghana and Tanzania). If means-tested old-age pensions exist and shall be maintained, universal pensions as a top up scheme only make a difference for the income distribution if the existing schemes do not reach the entire vulnerable population such as in Ecuador. Costs for the proposed schemes are substantial.

Title:Tax-benefit Microsimulation and Income Redistribution in Ecuador
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to explore the redistributive effects of taxes and benefits in Ecuador using two different approaches: direct use of reported taxes and benefits in survey data, and use of simulated taxes and benefits. We make use of representative household microdata from ENIGHUR 2011-2012, which contains detailed information on labour and nonlabour income, taxes and social insurance contributions, public pensions, social benefits and expenditure, as well as personal and household characteristics. First, ECUAMOD, the tax-benefit microsimulation model for Ecuador is used to simulate cash benefit entitlements, personal income tax and social insurance contribution liabilities, as well as indirect taxes. Then, the redistributive effect of simulated tax-benefit policies is compared to that obtained from taxes, social insurance contributions and benefits taken directly from the data. Our results show that simulated taxes and social insurance contributions capture better the number of taxpayers and aggregate revenue amounts from official statistics, compared to information taken directly from the data. Moreover, using reported data on taxes and social insurance contributions underestimates their redistributive effect, compared to simulated policies. Underreporting of income components in survey data and the difficulty of simulating complex eligibility rules for  benefits in microsimulation models are some of the factors driving the differences between the two approaches. Our paper concludes with a discussion of the advantages offered by microsimulation for policy analysis

Title: Policy Transparency in the Public Sector: The Case of Social Benefits in Tanzania
Abstract: In this paper we explore the eligibility criteria for the social benefits that form part of the Productive Social Safety Net programme in Tanzania — the Basic Cash Transfer and Variable Cash Transfer. An account is given of how simplified variants of these criteria were applied within TAZMOD, a static tax-benefit microsimulation model for Tanzania, in order to estimate take-up rates for these benefits. Confronted by the opaque and discretionary elements of the current benefits, we then simulate several categorical benefit alternatives which overcome many of the challenges of the current design, including a revenue neutral option that is more effective at reducing poverty and inequality. It is argued that by shifting to categorical benefits and removing the community targeting, proxy means-test, and conditionality elements, transparency would be enhanced. This would not only enable more accurate monitoring of access to and take-up of the benefits but would also enable citizens to determine their eligibility which is currently not possible.

Title: Quantifying the Impacts of Expanding Social Protection on Efficiency and Equity: Evidence from a Behavioral Microsimulation Model for Ghana
Abstract: A key challenge facing developing countries when they are gradually building up their social protection system is the presence of a large informal sector. Social safety nets should be expanded to reduce poverty, but financing social protection through higher taxes may reduce the number of formal-sector jobs available. The aim of this paper is to quantify the impacts of a revenue-neutral expansion of social protection in a developing country on both income distribution and efficiency which we measure via the impacts on formal sector work. Results from a new tax-benefit microsimulation model for Ghana, GHAMOD, are combined with the extensive margin elasticity of the share of formal work with respect to the tax wedge on formal labour, derived from repeated cross-section econometric estimates. The size of the estimated formality elasticity is modest and therefore the distributional gains of expanding cash transfer programmes are considerable, even when taking into account behavioural impacts.
